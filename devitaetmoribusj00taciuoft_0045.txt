THE GERMANIA.

THE PURPOSE OF THE GERMANIA.

WHEx Tacitus published the Agyre‘cola, in 98 A.1›.‚ he had
already planned. as we lesu-n from his prefaee (011. 3, 29 fi),
the composition 01 a Histoi-y 01 his Own Times. It appeared
about a decade later, und compi-ised the narrative from the
death 01 Nero to that 01 1)(’11111111111 (os—96 A.1›.)‚ the story
being subsequently supplemented by the Aumls, dealing
with the preceding period from the death 01 Augustus
<14 Α.11.’).

Now, among the events which oeeurred within the first
century 01 the Empire's existenee, few 01111 be mentioned
that vied in intrinsio importanee with the constant struggles
01 Rome with the barbarian tribes 01 Gei·inany‚-—a fact
made conspicuously apparent by the amount 01 attention
which Tacitus devotes 10 this subjeet in the works referred
to. Under these oirmunstanoes, the eonseientious historiali
must have felt the need 01 gathering froin all sourees
aeeessible to him—and they lay in profusion 111-0111111 111111
—what eould be learned eoneerning these semi-civilized
tribes 01 the North, who had so often routed Roman legions
and proved so effective a barrier against Roman aggression
and world-dominiou. The material thus seeured must soon ’

have aeeumulated to an extent whieh made it impossible
