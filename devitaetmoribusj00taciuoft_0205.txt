1116 phrase cp. Curt. VI. 3. T, 2, Imperio auspicioque perdomui. The
imperium Romanum is here, as res publica elsewhere, even in Cicero,
personified for the evident purpose of avoiding the name of the
emperor, usual in these formulae, for otherwise the credit for the
great victory would have been given (1116011)Υ 10 Domitian. That
Agricola is made. to identify himself with his army (nostra) is in
perfect keeping With the modesty of his character. Cp. esp. ch. 18,
17 ff.; 30, ὅ.

but by actual possession, and unlike Caesar, qui potest videri osten-
disse posteris (sc. Britanniam) ozon tradidisse (ch. 13, ⁶20).-—fama
(κλέος) and rumor (ὄσσα) are distinguished, in that the former is
vague, intangible, not traceable to any human agent, while the latter
implies some definite opinion or infin'mation which lacks authority or
substantiati0n3 it is the inore specific terni, firma the inore general,
both being often combined, eg. Caes. Β. G. VI. 20, 13 Liv. XX. 39,
18, and esp. Ovid. Met. XII. 45³1 ff.

8. castris et armis: the two terms balance fama nec rumore,
