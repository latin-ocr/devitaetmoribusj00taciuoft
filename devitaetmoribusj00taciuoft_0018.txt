ἀγώνων ἤθη, and it does not seem acoidental that by far the
larger number of ethieal or personal traits of Agricola is
accumulated in the very next chapters in accordance with
the rhetorical rules, and that there is, in fact, scarcely one

nes, Theon, Menander, and others.2

is the πράξεις or achieveinents of the hero,3 but in the Agyricola
there follow ch. 10-13, dealing with the ethnology and

declar-ed this to be an irrelevant episode could now even

rescue which fully vindicates the discussion of these very
subjects under this head} a passage the inore significant,
