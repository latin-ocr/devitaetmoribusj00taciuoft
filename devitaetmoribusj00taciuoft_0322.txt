15. 6515: a non-Germanic tribe, as is clear from ch. 43, 13. Of
the alternatives here offered, only the first hypothesis is ethnologically
acceptable. The Osi, possibly by agreement, remained in their terri-
tory while their kinsmen, the Aravisci, crossed the Danube, the
departure being probably due to over-population. A similar cause for
the migration of certain Gallie tribes is given by Liv. Τ. 34, 3, but this
plausible solution of the problem did not occur to Tacitus or his
authorities, as 1116 following eum clause shows

16. eodem . . . moribus: isdem must be supplied with the
plurals out of eodem. The order in which these criteria are given is the
usual one in Tacitus. Cp. ch. 43, 13 ; 40, :3 ; Hisc. lI. :37 3 111.3:†3. Τ116

17. Adhuc, i.e. 111 spite of the separation. institutis, political as
well as religious ; moribus, customs. Both ternis are combined, eg.
Anu. VI. 32.

18. pari . . . inopia ac libertate: the argument is far from con-
vincing. tor the very poverty here mentioned may well have been due
to the fact that the produce of the soil was no longer adequate to the
needs of the population. See previous note. eadem: note the
emphatic position. utriusque ripae: sc. Danuvii.

ful of the Belgi-‘tn Gauls, well known to us from Caesar's campaign
against 1116111, which ended in their virtual extermination. Caesar
(B. G. II. 4, l), Strabo (IV. 23, 4 p. 104). and Appian (Hist. Rom.
IV. 1, 4) make them out to be Germans, and the Belgi-ans generally
claimed a Germanic origin, which Teis-itus, however. with a touch of
