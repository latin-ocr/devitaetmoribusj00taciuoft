an ‘s.' So perhaps also 37, 22, humus, sed for humus et, as suggested
by Halm.

31, 26. in patientiam bellaturi] ῖη paenitentiam (erma laturi—-

VVex ; ἱη paenitentiam laturi— MSS—The emendation of ll'csr is by
. far the simplest of the many suggested, and is highly satisfactory in
sense. I can see no force in iVoelfflin’s objection that the Britons had
already taken up arms, and could not, therefore, be said laturi. Nor
can Ι understand Why Tacitus (as F. ad loc. maintains) should have
shrunk from using a perfectly intelligible phrase like arma ferre in
paenitentiam. Paenitentiam might of course be regarded as the false
solution of the compendium for patientiam, which, be it observed.
is not found in the MSS. ; but even if it were, the former would be
the difficilior lectio, because a less cominonplace, and therefore a
more Tacitean, antithesis to libertatem* than patz'mztiam. iVe shall
take up arms against the Romans, says Calgacus, in the hope of secur—
ing our liberty, and not in the expectation of having ever to regret
the attempt, as was the case with the Brigantes.

32, 9. alia : possibly this represents the compendium for aliena, a
reading highly snitable to the context, but see note note ad loc.

33, 1. virtute vestra] virtute ec—MSS.—Peter alone of recent
editors has defended the traditional reading, but I cannot accept his
reasons. imperinm Romanum does not merely represent the substitu-
tion ot' an abstract for the concrete. but is clearly a personification used
to avoid the mention of Domitian. for the successes referred to belong
for the chief part in the reign of that emperor, Peter erroneously sup-
posing that the abstract was employed so as to include Vespasian,

.Titus, and Domitian. The Empire once personified, it was as natural
as it was legitimate to predicate virtus, or any other quality of it.
See also note ad loc. I have, therefore, had no hesitation in restoring
the reading of the MSS. ’

33, 9. montesve] montesque—Urlichs. The suggestion of an
alternative is quite out of place, the aim of the speaker being to give
a cumulative effect in the enumeration of the hardships the Roman
soldier had overcome. The collocation, paludes montesque etflnmz'na,
is, moreover, exeeedingly common in Tacitus, -ve -et, not being found
at all. Cp. note ch. 12, 3.

33, 11. acies] veniunt—Schoene; ananus—MSS. Dare aciem
occurs only in Val. Flacc. V. (517, and should, therefore. not have been
forced upon T. veniunt, though not a certain emendation, gives an
excellent sense and is methodieally as justifiable as acies.
