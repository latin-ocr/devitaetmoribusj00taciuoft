Chapter 24. 19. spectaculorum unum . . . idem z in glaring
contrast with the niultiplicity and variety of Roman shows, the Ger-
mans had but one public game, and even that admitted of no variety. —-
unum atque ulem, a frequent combination, like our one (17ch the same,
is here separated, partly to emphasize idem, partly to avoid a common-

erz'ny, forming the transition from the preceding chapters, which
dealt with convivia. The following condensed paragraph is the locus
classicus on the famous German swerd clance (for the spem· was subse-

till the 17th century.

20. Nudi: here again, as in ch. 20, 24, to be taken litei-any, the

evidence to the contrary belonging to a later period. quibus se.

ch. 2, 3. ludicrum est: enslscsle in this sporc. 111 the sense of

ludus, the word is used first in Catull. lxi. 24; thereafter it is quite
common in both poetry and prose, but especially so in Tacitus.

21. infestas: clo-eatenzssny, because pointed at the (lanc-ers. The
term is a standing epithet of a weapon. Cp. eg. Caes. Β. C. III. 93,

from a Hessian town near Fulda as late as 1571. This use of quamvis
with an adjective is especially frequent in Tacitus. lasciviae ε the
word is used in a good sense, as always in Cicero, but in Tacitus only
