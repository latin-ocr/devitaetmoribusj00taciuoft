30. testimonium: memoria could not have been used with prat?-
scntz'um bonorum, because the still uncoinpleted reign of Τι’-(131111 was
included among these. But⁷ when the Hz'scorz'ac had been published7
their author had decided to reserve the record oi Nerva's and Trajan's
beneficent rule for an iaulependent work, a plan either abandoned or
frustrated by his death. Cp. Hisc. Ι. 1, quod si rica εηρῃριῐίίρῦ, prin-
cipatum Nervae ct imperimn Traiane? . . . senectuti soposwt

31. interim: i0e. pending the conclusion of niy larger and strictly
historical narrative.

32. laudatus erit aut excusatus: cp. Dial. ch. 10, 7, probata sic
fides ec libertas accusata. — The fut. perf. with reference to the reader's
completed perusal of the biography. Cp. note ch. 1, 14, opus fnit

Page 3. Chapter 4. 1. Gnaeus Iulius Agricola: this is the
only certain instance in Tacitus in which the tria nomina Romanorum
occur. They are designed to give to the beginning of the biography
proper a special soleinnity. Foroiuliensium colonia: a town in
Gallia Narbonensis, 011 the Mediterranean, founded by Julius Caesar
in 46 13.c.; during the early enipire it was a naval station oi some iin-
portance. It is the modern Fr6jus, situated 45 miles northeast oi
Toulon. ,

2. procuratorem Caesarum: the procurators were Officers in the
imperial household, appointed by, and solely responsible to, the em-
peror. These positions were originally held by freedinen and equites
alike, but as the adininistrative functione of the emperor extended‚
the higher and more responsible procuratorships were given only to
knights, who were then generally distinguished from the minor ‘pro-
curatores' as procuratores Azegszcstz'. Caesarina happens to be found
only here, but Caesaris may have been equally official, the plural
being used doubtless because the grandfathers referred to served sep-
arately under Augustus and Tiberius⁷ or under both. But cp. Dz'al.

3. quae: by attraction for quod. Cp. ch. 7, 83 Germ. 5, 18.
equestris nobilitas: these offices had become one of the marks of
an equestrian career, ior 111611 of senatorial rank were debarred froin
holding a procuratorship. The expression itself7 in place οῖ’ ordo
equestris5 seems not to occur elsewhere, and is here used in the sanie
technical sense which Tacitus rcpeatedly gives to equites inlustres or
insz'gsnes„ namely, knights occupying high positions. The exact equiv-
alent‚ equites nobiles, is also found7 eg. Liv. XXIII. 46, 12.
