second marriage in the case 01 an adulteress is in praiseworthy con-
trast with Roman usage, those communities approach a still higher
ideal among whom no second marriages, even 01 vvidows, are per-
mitted. It is not known what German tribes the author had 111 mind,
but the same rigid rule obtains among the North Frisians 01 to-day,
and there are traces 01 a custom resembling the Hindoo suttee in
northern legends. Thelofty motives here ascribed to the Germans
are, as usual, (1110 to the enthusiasm 01 the author, such abstract reflec-
tions being naturally foreign to half civilized peoples. Cp. note 011. 7, 5.

17. spe votoque uxoris : clm hope and vow of 1110111090. semel
transigitur : ic is (lone rwith 011ορ for (cll. Cp. 1191. 34, 5 ; Anu. 11.65;
and Liv. IX. 12, 11. Of semel 111 this sense, 110 certain instance is found
in pre-'l‘acitean prose. Itis, however, common in poetry, eg. Verg.
Aen. XI. 4183 Ovid, Her. V. 104; X. 112, aud in the Church fathers,

18. Sic . . . quo modo: 101 the more usual sic . . . ut. So eg.
Dz'ol. 315, 28 1. ; Ayr. 34. 29. With the thought, cp. Prop. V. 11, 36,
in lapide hoc zeni nustcafuz'sse legsar, and the frequent epithets πηίίἰιῃα,
univira, 010, on sepulchral inscriptions, eg. C. Ι. L. II. 78, uno con-
tenta marito. unum . . . unamque: anaphora 01 adjectives, rare
111 other writers, is especially common in Tacitus Cp. ch. 14, 18 ; and
note Dic-cl. 40, 13.

20. ne tamquam . . . ament: 1.0. 5110 should not, as it were,
love the married state as such, 101· 111 that case a community could
not but encourage Widows to remarry, but she was to remain true to
the end of 1101 days to the memory 01 the husband 01 1101 youth.

21. Numerum . . . finire: ιο rescriccthe nmnber of children, a
practice common among the wealthier classes in Rome. Cp. Juv.
II. 29 ff. ; VI. 3⁶6 ff. 3 595. The Germans were, however, permitted,
at least at a later 111110, 10 expose newborn children, 11 deformed, or 101
other causes, and to sell them into slavery. Fessnz're: definire. So
Dial. 38, 15; Amr. XIII. 38, 49, with numerus as here.

22. adgnatis z ἐπιγόνοις. So Hisc. V. 5, necare quemquam θῦε
adynate's nefas (sc. Iudaeis). The word is often used in the restricted
sense 01 50115, born after the father had made hiswill3 but as there
were no wills among the Germans (cp. ch. 20, G), it must here refer to
younger sons in general. This in turn would seem to imply the ex-
istence 01 the custom 01 primogeniture which Tacitus, however, ap-
pears to restrict to the Tencteri (see note ch. 32, 4). The incongruity,

superficial information on these subjects. plusque ibi boni mores,
