29, and very frequently elsewhere in Tacitus.

14. terra: se. veniebant, to be supplied by an easy zeugma out of
acluehelmncur.

15. quaerebant With infinitive is a ἅπαξ εἰρημένον 111 Tacitus,
but common in poetry and post-Augustam prose. utque sic dixe—
rim: on this phrase, see note to Assya 3, 25. It is here used by way
of apology for the bold personification involved in adem-sus (hostile)
Oceanus. The meaning antipodral, usually given to adversus here, is
incompatible with Tacitus' conception of the eartlrs form. See note
Aar. 12, 1.

16. raris: raro. On this usage, cp. ch. 6, 5, and notes Dz‘al.

Italy in Assia 12, 29.

17. praeter: not to mention. Cp. ch. 44. 12 ; Assr. 4, 10. Asia

of symmetry with the preceding· ablatives. The last clause in the
asyndeton trimvml‘tre is, as usual in Tacitus, amplified, (fulcu referring,
in chiastic order, to the second, adspectu to the first. Cp. ch. 13, 11 ;
18, 13 30, 7; 45, 14; Am: 30, 2³³& 36, 273 44, 6. nisi si patria
sit: as the tense, hy the side of peteret (deliberative subj.), shows, the
clause is intended to quality only the last member of the asyndeton,
tristem, etc. — nisi si, a weaker substitute for si, very common in T.,
generally takes the indicative 3 here the subjunctive seems to be used
to express the author's doubt as to a German's love of country being
sufficiently strong to cause him to overlook the dismal cliniatic con-
ditions. With the sentiment, cp. Homer, Odyss. IX. 27 f., and Sen.
