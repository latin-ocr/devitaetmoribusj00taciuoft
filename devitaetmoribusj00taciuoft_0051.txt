THE PURPOSE or THE GERMANIA. xlv

of further aggressive campaigns, by showing what formi-
dable and invineible enemies these Ger-mans had been 111 1116
11631. It thus constituted, though only by 31116111111111111166-
tion, the very key-note of the treatise. But if so, the inser-
tion of this passage was singular-ly taetless and insulting, 111
11161 1116 author would have depreciated the ability of so great
a general, as Trajan admittedly was, to eope successfully
with these foes, on the ground that all his predecessors had
ignoininously failed. Again, 111 6 1101111061 pamphlet, de-
signed for the immediate present, the statement that it was
written in the second Consulship of Trajan would be as gra-
tuitous as if an American pamphleteer to—day, in an article
written for the American public, were to tell his readers
that the Philippine insurrection occurred during the third
year of McKinley's administration. In a scientific 1110110-
graph, however, elaborated into a work of litei-ary art and as
such intended for posterity, the chronological data referred
to are eminently proper. The entire chapter was, nioreover,
so manifestly suggested by the incidental mention of the
Cimbri, once so powerful but now so insignificant, that the
assumption of any ulterior purpose for its insertion is in no
way justified.

Finally, the very style of the Germania precludes its
having ever been intended as a political pamphlet, for this
imperatively called for a distinctively oratorical treatment,
belonging, as it did, to what the ancient rhetoricians term
,1116 λόγος ψόγου, 1116 0111103116 of the encomium.1

We must, therefore, conclude that the treatise de orz'yz'nc,

an ethico-political treatise‚ but this, apart from being open to 1116
objections pointed out above, is quite ineompatible with the as-
sumption that its author was a practica] statesnian who wrote for
contemporaries in support of a definite policy. Tacitus was not a
philosophical rhetorician and political theorist like Isocrates.
