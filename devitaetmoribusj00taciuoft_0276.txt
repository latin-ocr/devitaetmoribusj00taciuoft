the preposition in asyndetic and adversative clauses, here combined,
see Introd, p. lxvii. Observe the climax. Not only do the lower
classes as is but natural, and the more enlightened nobles place
implicit confidence in this mode of divination, but the very priests
themselves honestly believe in its efficacy, this being iu glaring con-
mast with the cynically avowed rationalism of the Roman haruspices.
Cp. especially Cimde div. Π. 24, 51, illud Catonis admodum scitwn
est, qui mirsam* se aiebat qnod uon rideret haruspex, haruspicem cum
vidisset. The omission of etiam after sed, when correlated with non
solum, modo, tantum, though extremely frequent in the Historz'es and
Annals, occurs in the minor works only here, Dial. 32, 15 and Assr.
3, 16.

23. ministros: merely the sormam, z‘ntemrecers, like ὑποφῆται.
The ellipsis of tammam is a characteristic Latin idiom. illos: sc.
equos. conscios : are directly conversant with the divine resolutions.

25. gentis z nationis, tribe, as often in its restricted sense. Cp.
note ch. 2, 14. cum qua: the p‹1›stp‹*›sitive collocation of cum
with a relative pronoun is not found in 'l‘acitus, except Anu. Ι. 25,
where, however, quilucscwn occurs in a direct citation from a letter of
Tiberius.

27. popularium: elansmfln. quemque: utrumque. So in
Tacitus again, He'sc. Ι. 82; ΙΙ. (3(1; Ami. VI. 42.

28. conmittunt: pic agsaezz'izst, a technical term of the arena. So
eg. Juv. I. 162, and especially frequent in Suetonius, but rare else-
where. pro praeiudicio: similar contests are found among the
Greeks, Romans (cp. the Horatii and Curiatii), and later Germanic
tribes, but they all, like the jmlgsment ο] Gocl, common down to the
lOth century, were not regarded as prelimz'nary, but as definitely
decisive of the issue.

Ghapsser 11, The discussion of divination naturally leads to a
description of public assemblieS, which were never organized before
the auspicia had been observed.

30. De minoribus rebus: what. these were cannot be determined ;
probably they comprised the ceremony of the investiture with arms
(ch. 113, 231) and manumission of slaves. principes: contrasted
with omnes, and here almost equivalent to nobiles, the usual vagne-
ness attaching to the term, as elsewhere in this treatise, especially
when used in thc plural. See below. l. 27. consultant: as the
following shows. this deliberation virtually amounted to a (lecision.
