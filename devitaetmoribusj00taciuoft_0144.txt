synonymous expressions occurring with constantly decreasing frc-
quency from the Dz'aloslus to the second part of the Ammls, see
Introd. p. xxix—On the brachylogy in this sentence, see Iam-od.
p. xxxiii. celeberrimus quisque ingeniozclarz'ssz'ma emenia.
Iti-(lenium is not used in the singular in a personal sense, hence cele-
berrimmn quodque inssenz'um was impossible here. Celeber z clarus
seems to occur first in Tibull. II. 1, 33.

8. sine gratia aut ambitione: i.e. without the desire of curry-
ing favor or from selfish motives. Our knowledge of the historialis
of the Republic, particularly the later aiiiialists, does not ‘bear out
this favorable view.

9. bonae . . . conscientiae pretio: i.e. by the reward that
waits on duty well performed. Cp. Αηη. ΙΙ. 22. —pretio Ξ praemio.

10. plerique: many. This weakened sense is the 111010 usual in
Tacitus and 111 post-Augustali Latin generally. suam ipsi z for suam
ipsos (zsuam ipsorum). We should have expected ipsos (subj. of
narrare) in accordance with Tacitus's custom of making ipse, when
combined with a personal or possessive pronoun, the subj. For an
instance of the usage with a finite verb, see 011. 46, 25. —Observe that
two ideas here coalesce into one. (a) They wrote antobiographies.
(b) They did not think it open to censure to do so. —On the concise-
ness of this clause, see Introd. p. xxxiii. Δ

11. Rutilio et Scauro: P. Rutilius Rufus, born about 158 13.c.,
cons. 105 n.c., a distinguished orator, jurist, historiali, and pupil of
the Stoic Panaetius. In 93 Β.0. 110 was accused by one Apicius of
extortion. Besides his autobiography, orations, and legal publica-
tions‚ he composed a Roman History in Greek. He is extravagantly
praised by Cicero and others—HI. Aemilius Scaurus, his bitter
opponent, was born 162 B.c., and died about 89 13.c. His autobiogra-
phy, in three books, seems to have been an apoloffl'a pro rita 31111. —-
et for azae, partly because these men are closely associated as contem-
poraries and autobiographers, partly owing to the auc following. It
must be observed, however, that the Latin, as well as the Greek, has
a peculial· fondness for the copulative conjrmction. where our idiom
prefers the disjunctive particle. Cp. e. g. δύο καὶ τρεῖς (two or three) 3
ch. 29, 24 ; Germ. 19, conrumpere et conrumpzss,· Αηη. ΙΙ. 10.

12. citra z sine. Though extremely common in post-Augustam
Latin, especially in Quintilian, this usage is found in Tacitus only in
the minor works. -On the collocation of a prepositional clause, and
an ablative or dative, one of the noteworthy features of Tacitean
