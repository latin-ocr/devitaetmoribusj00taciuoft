explanatory of quieti secretique. the clause nullis . . . populantur
referring to sine impotentia in elziastz'c order, as often in Tacitus, at
the close of a period. For this post-Augustali meaning of provocare.
cp. Hist. II. 61, p. 111-ωας l'lin. Panes). 16, 1, bella nou prot-acus.

10. raptibus et latrociniis: so combined, Hz’sc. Ι. 46; II. 58, per
latrocinia ec raptus, latrocinia being the narrower term. This state-
ment is contradicted by Tacitus himself 111 Anu. XI. 18, where he
speaks of wauton predatory raids of the Chauci, Μαῖα dissensione
(lomi. They were defeated by Corbulo 111 47 ΑΛ). populantur:

11. virtutis ac virium : the same alliterat1ve collocation occurs,
eg. Cic. <Ie orat. II. 27, 12.

12. ut superiores agant : their superior-icy, objectos ‹ulsequuntm·.

13. sires poscat: a foi-inulaic phrase. Cp. eg. ch. 44, 17 ; Dc'al.
31, 43 Hz'st. Ι. 79; ΙΙ. 5. exercitus: an oryuui‘zezl army, as op-
posed to arma. 'l'he term is rarely applied to non-Roman forces· (eg.
ch. 30, ὃς 43, 3). Here it is in the nature of a compliment, quite 111
keeping with the eulogistic tone of the chapter. Prompcus esc must
be supplied out of the preceding prompta.

14. plurimorum: here, as often 111 TacituS, used 111 its weakened
sense of ¹very wamy. Cp. note ch. 1, 9. virorum equorumque z
peditum equitumque, a stereotyped phrase more usually in inverse
order, but, as here, eg. His-t. 11. 703 III. :23 and Cic. de off. III. 33,
116, rz'rz's equz'sque (with mz'yhc und main). quiescentibus z in

Chapter 36. 16. Cherusci: their great career 111 history began
with the crushing defeat of Varus in the Teutoburg Forest in 9 A.1).,
under their illustrious leader, Arminius, to whom Tacitus has paid
a celebrated tribute in Anu. ΙΙ. 88, liberator haud dubie (θεν-
maniae . . . proeliis (multifluus, bello uon victus, After his assassina-
tion 111 19 An, the Cherusci fell a prey to internecine feuds with the
Chatti. In 84-5 ΑΛ). they had so far degenerated as to invoke the aid
of Domitian, who, however, only gave them money. After Tacitus'
time they disappear from history, their name figur-ing in later writers
only as a literary reminiscence. For their location, see map.

17. marcentem: euerratinss‚ here used by metonymy, cause for
effect. So similarly Dial. 12. 17, santam pallentem, where see note.
inlacessiti: a Tacitean word, oecurring only here and Aur. 20. 23.
