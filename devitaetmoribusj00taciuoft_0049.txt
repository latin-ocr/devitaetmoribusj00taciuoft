possessed works in abundance which could have satisfied
this hypothetical craving. The alleged opportuneness of the
publication of the treatise is purely accidental. Tacitus, as
he tells us himself, had written nothing throughout the reign
of Domitian (Agyr. 3, 26 ff). then, with the death of the
cruel despot in 96 A.D.‚ it again became possible, to use
his own words, sentire quoe velis et quae sentias (licere, he
also ventured to break the silence to which he had been
condemned so long, and there appeared in rapid succession
the noble biography of his father-in-law‚ Agricola, and our

for Tacitus has given us the terminus ante quem himself
(ch. 37, 5 ff), the striking significance of the publication, in
98 A.D., must be pronounced purely imaginary, and hence all
the inferences which have so freely been drawn from this
assumption fall to the ground.

But even if the conclusions just refuted were less arbitrary
and gratuitous than they are, positive (evidence, destructive
of the hypothesis under notice, is by no means lacking.

If the Germania had been intended as a politica] brochum,
it is impossible to understand why every indication of its
character should be so absolutely wanting. We know but
little, it is true, of this species of literature among the
Romans, but, though extensively resorted to in the last days
of the Republic, it must have been for obvious reasons ex-
ceedingly rare under the Empire. In any case, the fact can-
not be too strongly emphasized that a pamphlet which
studiously avoids everything of a political nature, which
