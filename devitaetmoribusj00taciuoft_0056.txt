tion, and if it be further observed that Tacitus was in every
instance in possession of. fuller and inore reliable knowl-
edge than was vouchsafed to Caesar, we cannot but reject
the assumption of extensive indebtedness, and must conclude
that the &onmemtem-ies, though certainly (locuinents of prime
importance, cannot, in the eyes of Tacitus, writing as he
did inore than a century later, have had anything inore than
an historical interest and value.

Two other works, also still extant, have without misgiv-
ings or qualifications been likewise put down among the
certain sources of the Germania, naniely, the Olcoroyraplze'u
of one Pomponius sslela (c. 50 A.1›.) and the so-called Natural
Hz‘story of the elder Ple'ny, numerous alleged reseinblances‚
both in contents and phraseology, having been adduced in
support of this view. {ut this inference is vitiated at

a 111-111 foundation. It may be briefly forinulated by saying
that inere similitude, though apparently never so striking,
does not in itself afford any reliable clew to indebtedness,
provided there exist side by side equally noteworthy diver-
qences or contradictions; even where this is not the case,
the possibility inust always be taken into consideration that
such parallelisms are due either to a common third source
or conditioned by the siinilarity of the subject-matter.

Now, if we apply this cardinal principle to the two
authors in question, it will be found that the hitherto uni-
versally accepted conclusion that Tacitus was directly 111-
debted to them is unwarranted by the facts.

in his Preface, that the subJ'ect does not lend itself
