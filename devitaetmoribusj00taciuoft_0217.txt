I'AGE 26] No'i‘isss. anrTER 39. 133

animo anxius—On the adjective for the adverb, cp. 011. 5, 2. exce-
pit: the fact that Tacitus is able to report Domitian's behavior, and
the use 01 excepit for aceepit, seem 10 imply, on the 0110 hand, the
presence of witnesses; on the other, that the letter was read to the
emperor. Inerat conscientia: the same phrase occurs Hist.
III. 86.

7. derisui: (111 object of moclsery. A rare post-Augustali word,
eg. Sen. Contr. IV. prooem. 10. See note ch. 32, 18. nuper
falsum . . . triumphum : the campaign against the Chatti. in 83 A.1).,
again sneeringly allutled to 111 Germ. 37, 24, triumphati maffl's quam
victi sunt. Although Domitian (lid not win any military laurels him-
5011, the war, carried on under his auspices, resulted 111 a permanent
extension 01 the Roman limes or frontier, as Tac. Germ. 29, 19,
though he purposely conceals Domitian's name, admits.

8. emptis, etc. : a similar story is told (11 Caliqzcla by Suet. Cal.
47, who relates that the emperor made 1115 pseudo-barbarians non
tantum rutilare et submittere comam secl et sermonem Gernzsmzieum
addiscere ec nominet barbarica ferre. It is to this first sliam triumph
that 'Paeitus seems to allude in Germ. 37, -20, mose inssentes Gai Cate-
sarz's minas in ludibrium versae (z derisui fuisse).

11. celebrari: depends upon inerat conscientia. An accusative
with infinitive governed by a noun, and 011011, as 11010, followed by
indirect discourse, is quite 00111111011; eg. 011. 9, 242 40, 243 413. 43
Hz'sc. V. 20 ; Αηη. Ι. 5. — 011 1110 conciseness 01 expression, see Introcl.
p. xxxiii. Id sibi . . . formidulosum: sc. esse videbatur. to be
supplied by zeugma out 01 inerat conscientia, the presence 01 sibi
preventing the latter from being retained as the governing clause.
Cp. Introd. p. xxxii. privati hominis 1. substet. This, not civil-
ian, as contrasted with magsz'stratus, 15 1110 regular meaning 01 privatus
111 post-Augustali writers. With the statement 115011, cp. Dio Cass.
LXVI. 20, ἅτε καὶ μείζονα ἦ κατὰ στρατηγὸν καταπράξας (SC. Ἀ’γρικόλας).

12. studia fori et civilium artium decus : the pzcrszcz'c of ι1111011510

the blighting effect of Domitian's despotism, see 011. 2; Ρ1111. Epist.
VIII. 14, 23 Panes). 66. 76.

14. cetera: all other eminent accomplz'shments. utcumque:
somehow or other, vin a measure. So often, especially in Livy and
Tacitus. dissimulari: be igsnorecL overlooked, a not uncommon
meaning 01 the word in Tacitus.
