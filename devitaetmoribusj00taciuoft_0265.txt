known Latin euphemism, the absolute use of the verb. however, is
very rare. - Α few instances are recorded in later times, eg. Dexippus.
a Vandal king, killed a (lux for violating a treaty, and Clzlodnrr‘eh
slew a soldier who angered him at a military review. Caes. R. G, v1.
23, 4, in only apparent contradiction to Tacitus, expressly attributes the
power over life and death to vistai-stratus qni ei lwlln praesint, for he
seems to make a distinction between the nucye'scmcns as a body and
the principes acting as individuals.

3. verberare: in strong contrast with Roman custom, which pcr-
mitted even centurions to inflict corporal punishment upon soldiers.
Cp. Anu. I. 23. This was considered so degrading to a German free-
man as to involve the loss 01 his civic rights. sacerdotibus: this
is also at variance with Caes. B. G. VI. 21. 1, neque Druides liabent
qui rebus divinis praesunt neque sacrificiis student, hut the passage
only denies the existence of a religious caste or priesthood, not that
of priests altogether. Resides, Tacitus may on the one hand have
been in possession of better sources of int'tmnation, while Czesar's
statement may have been applicable to but a single tribe. The
remaining alternative, that conditions had undergone a change in the
interval, is less probable.

5. quem adesse, etc: either Wodan, Tin, the god of war, or
77mnar-Hercules. 011 whom see ch. 3, 17 ff. In the Tentonic epics, pre-
eisely as in the Homeric, the gods personally participate in battles.
The motive here given for this relegation of punishments to the
priests is doubtless imaginary, as are the other profonnd reflections
which T. attributes to the Germuns. Cp. ch. 8, 25; 9, 3; 12, 21 ff.;
14, 3 f.; 18, 29 ff.; 19, 19; 22, ὃΐΐ.; 24, 22. 31; 27, 29 f.; 28. 21;

6. Effigies: these are images of animals sacred to different deities,
the Germans having no idols (ch. (ζ), 2). Thus 1Vodan was worshipped
under the form of a snake and the wolf was sacred to him, as the boar
to Freyr, the bear to Donar, the ram to Tin. Similarly among the
Greeks we have the eagle of Zeus, the dove of Venus. the owl of
Athene, the horse of Poseidon, 010. The German tokens reappear
later in heraldic signs. signa: weapons symbolizing the attributes
of the gods, as the spear of Wodan, the sword of T iu, the hammer ot'
Donar. lucis: sor the Germans possessed no temples. Cp. ch. 9, 2.

7. ferunt: the subject is probably general or Germani, as in
credunt, but detracta can only apply to the sacerdotes who alone
