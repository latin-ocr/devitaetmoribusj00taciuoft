LITERARY CHARACTER OF THE AGRICOLA. iX

It is asserted that the work contains too much historica]
matter for a biography and too many biographical features
101 3 history. In the second place, the detailed account 01
the ethnology and geography 01 Britain, and the elaborate
speeches put into the mouth 01 ’5116 Caledonian chieftain
and 01 ’5116 Roman general on the eve 01 ’5116 decisive battle,
are pronounced to be wholly out 01 111306 111 3 genuine
biography. One scholar even went so 131 33 to lnaintain
that all. these alleged irrelevant portions, to which 116 added
the twenty-eighth chapter, commemorating the adventure
of the Usipi, were not originally designed to form an 111-
tegral part 01 ’51113 treatise, but represented certain 1116111111-
nary studies 01 the author, the results 01 which were to
be incorporated into 1113 lissam-sps, in the narrative 01 the
British campaigns under Domitian. Apart 110111 other con-
siderations ’50 116 mentioned presently, this hypothesis
makes it extremely difficult ’50 understand why the last
book of that work was not published till 109, 11 Tacitus
had as early as 97 already begun the collection 01 1113 1113-
teria] 101· the reign 01 Domitian. As a matter 01 fact, we
happen to know that as late as 106 116 was still searching
for information in connection with 311 event to be related
under the year 79 Α.11.1

But these objections are unwarranted, 101· not only do the
alleged sections so confidently pronounced irrelevant sub-
serve a definite and legitimate purpose, but—what has
hitherto been overlooked—it can be shown that Tacitus
has carefully conformed to the rules 01 rhetoric laid down
