the earlier work is, therefore, merely tantamount to saying
that Tacitus was its author. There is, consequently7 no
valid reason· for not accepting Tacitus’s own unequivocal
statement regarding the purpose of this biography.

TACITUS’S SOURCES OF INFORMATION.

That the son-in-law of Agricola was in possession of a
very considerable amount of first-hand authentic informa-
tion eoncerning Agricola's family, training, and early official
career goes without saying. And for the events and data
subsequent to Agricola's departure for Britain, Tacitus
‹loubtless also learned innumerable details from the living
lips of Agricola himself, although he is cited directly as
a source but three times (chs. 4, 15. 24, 13, and 44, 7).
Again, many items of information would naturally come to
his knowledge as being a contemporary3 still others were
probably transmitted to him by some who were with Agric-
ola in Britain. For the narrative of the years 89-93,
during which the author was absent from Rome, he could
also rely upon trustworthy oral testimony furnished to him
on his return.

In fact, the only items of information which involve the
assumption of a distinctly literam source are contained in
the survey of the earlier predecessors of Agricola and their
military campaigns. What this was cannot be determined.
Perhaps Fabam· Rusticus· was one of them, but that detailed
narratives were at his disposal is shown by the full account
given of some of these events, such as the uprising under
Boudicca (ch. 15 f), in his Annals.
