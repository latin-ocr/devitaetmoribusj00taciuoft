or edge of the disk-shaped earth. — The phenoinenon of the mid-
night sun is here given expressly on the authority of others (actm-mant)
and, as a matter of fact, it is not observed in even the most northerly
regions of Caledonia. In Germ. 45, 27, it is inore accurately ascribed
to N orway.

Page 9. 1. Scilicet, 616.; this fanciful and somewhat obscure
explanation was adopted by Tacitus from some earlier and unknown
pseudo-scientist. It implies the belief, generally reJ'eeted even in an-
tiquity, that the earth was a circular shield or c-oneave dij-lg the sun's
shadow being supposed to cause night. On the—presumably western,
unobstruoted edge (extrema ec plana terrarum) the shadow 6651 would
be lotv, falling far beneath the heaven with its stars; at the center the
more extended curvature of the surface would project it to a somewhat
greater height, thus bringing on deeper darkness, while at the opposite
extreniity there would be no shadow at all, or perpetual daylight.
extrema et pla-na : except 111 Sallust 511611 substantiva] adjectives are
found in pre-Tacitean prose only if they eonvey a partitive meaning.

2. caelum et sidera: on this collocation. see [Μίνωϊ. p. xxx.

3. praeter: erceptsny, a comparatively rare usage. In Tae. again:

treatise again, 611. 25, 24.

4. terris: the ablative of place where, though extremely common
111 Τ6611115, 15 still rare in the 11111101· writings. Cp. eg. 611. 25, 243

a vague term and therefore liable to convey a 16156 impression. -— With

5. tarde mitescunt, cito proveniunt: an adversative, not an
enumerative asyndeton which would involve an unealled for hysteron
