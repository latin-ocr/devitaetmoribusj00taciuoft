cp. eg. Diccl. 10, 15. iniectos: best taken in a good sense, not
caz'nced but elutnfsed. Cp. the noeaning of conrumpere in eh. 23. 13.

6. propriam et sinceram: <lisciaco (cml pure. Similar synonymic

'tl-›ubtless exaggerated and due to the general tendency of the Greeks
and Romans to idealize the peoples of the north. Cp. Iutrocl. p. lxiii.

soldiers seldom exceeded 5 feet Τ inches in height; hence the con-
stant marvel at the huge frames of their German foes. The statement
