them certain chants, etc. For a similar meaning of haec, which has
been variously interpreted, see Dz'al. 12, 8, lucrosae lenius . . . elo-
quentiae usus recens (the money-gsetciim eloquent-e cf tia-day is α neodem
practice). relatu: recz'tczl. A very rare word, occurring first in
Ovid, Fas-t. III. 541. ln Tacitus again, Hist. Ι. 30, relatu virtutum.

20. harditum: shz'elcl sonq, connected with Old Norse bai-dlii, a.
shz'eld, not with hard, which is purely Celtic, nor with heard, which
does not suit the present context. The barritum. with which bai-ditus
has often been identified, though used of a battle shout and of the cry
of elephants. was apparently quite different, to judge by its repeated
description in Ammianus Marcellinus and other writers.

21. ipso cantu: i.e. without reference to the contents of the ebant.

22. vocis ille . . . virtutis concentus: A harmony of valor
rather than of twice. It represented not so much a musical harmony,
as one militant spirit pervading the ranks. On the alliterative
antithesis, a favorite device of Tacitus. cp. Introd. Am: p. xxviii. In
this treatise again, ch. 14, :3 f.

23. Adfectatur : on the emphatic position of the verb, see Imm-od.
p. lxvi. It agrees in the singular with the nearer noun, and so gener-
ally, when placed at the beginning, as the predicate of two subject-s,

24. fractum: sabama. So Tac. Anu. XIV. 20, fractos sonos.

25. gravior: (topper. Ceterum: here merely a transitional
particle, i.e. not only are we told that Hercules came, but even
Ulysses, etc.

26. quidam opinantur: Probably Posidonius is the earliest
authority for this information. Cp. also Solinus, XXII. 1, who is
chiefly indebted to Pliny: ιή quo recessu Ulia-ew- Galeclantae adpul-
sum νηαηῑζῑὲεῐαῑ (ινα Graecis litteris 'inse-repca, and Introd. p. lvii.
According to Krates of Mallos, the 'famous head of the school of
Pergamum (2d cent. Bc), Odysseus reached India by crossing the
Atlantic. Thereafter we hear of various cities founded by hini, as
· Odyssea in Iberia, Olisippo in Spain (Lusitania), and traces of his
presence on the Rhine were also found. Cp. Claudian, in Rufin. I.
123. Doubtless all these traditions owe their origin to fancied re-
semblances to the name Ulixes, as olisippo above, and possibly
Ulohoxis in Germany. Opinantnr implies a less degree of credibility
than memorant. Cp. Dial. 2, 11. illo: on the medial position. cp.
Ιηῑνοᾱ. p, lxvi. fabuloso: renovmecl ῖη story. So eg. Hor. 0ιῖ. Ι.
22, 8, fabulosus Hydaspes, but in its usual sense, ch. 46, 24.
