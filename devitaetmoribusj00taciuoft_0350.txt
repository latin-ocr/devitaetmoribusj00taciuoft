the Chauci and the Semnones, but not the Cherusci, can be here
understood.

26. per obsequium: like the Cherusci, for example.

2⁷. proeliis ac periclitando: by arms ancl (1991658ιό11. On the
alliterative gronping, see Introd. p. lxviii, and on the favor-ite Tacitean
collocation of aper clause with 311 ablative, see ibid. p. lxx, Vell. Pat.
Lc. styles the Langobardi qens etiam Germana feritate ferocior, and
their later history in a measure confirms this statement. Reudigni z

the Anglii and Varini, the ancients knew as little 35 we do, see map.
deinde in a local sense, occurs in Tacitus only here, 611. 42, 1 3 44, 9, and
is generally rare, e.g. Liv.xx11. 4, 2, but dein is very commonly so used.

28. Aviones: not elsewhere mentioned. Anglii: the same
who, under Hengist and Horsa in the 5111 century, invaded Britain.
Ethnologically they seem to have belonged to the 531116 qens as the
Varini, the Πάνηῖ of later 1111165. They are probably identical with
the Thuringians in middle Germany, whence they migrated to the
Schleswig peninsula, the Anglii having, it would seem, preceded them.
This hypothesis would plausibly account for the title of their oldest
law: lem Anyliormn et Werz'norwn, 1106 est Th 21¹1·i11907·1(m. Eudfises ι
unless the order followed by Tacitus is quite hapliazard, which is in-
compatible with the systematic plan of these geographical Chapters,
his authorities or map must have placed this tribe south, not north, of
the Anglii and Varini. They are generally identified with the later
Jutes and supposed 10 be the sanie as the Φουνδούσιοι ot, Ptolemaeus,
who 1063165 them near the Cimbri (see map); but there is no evidence
for either of these identifications. Suard6nes : a wholly unknown
tribe, the very name being variously given in the Mss. Its location
15, therefore, purely conjectural.

Page 53. 1. Vit6nes: according to others, Nuithones, but this
name is also hopelessly corrupted in our Mss. Polysyndetic et, more
than twice repeated, is rare in Tacitus and exclusively confined to the
minor works. Cp. note Dial. 10, 14. fluminibus aui: silvis: so
combined again, Anu. II. 19. The phrase is peculiarly applicable to
the regions where we must suppose these tribes to have dwelt.
Nec quicquam . . . in conrnune: slightly illogical, for we expect
either nec . . . in illis, nisi quod, or nec . . . in sz'ngyulis, sedin com-
mune. Cp. ch. 27, l ff.; Ami. 111. 27. non 1110(ῖο in commune, sed
1'71 singulos homines.
