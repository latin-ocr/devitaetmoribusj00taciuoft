they were too blind to recognize this3 the other paints the

idealize will not in this instance satisfactorily account for
this noteworthy divergence, for the Chauci were a tribe well
known to the Romans. and Pliny’s description is probably
that of an eye-witness. if, therefore, the Natus-(il His-lory
was consulted by Tacitus, as we are assured, it is hard to
understand why he, with such trustworthy information
before him, deliberately discarded this authority in a inat-
ter in which he might so easily have been convicted of
misrepresentation.

But if this encyclopaedia must, therefore, be eliminate-d
from the probable sources of Tacitus, the same writer's
