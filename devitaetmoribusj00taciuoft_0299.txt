Plan 42] nores. CHAPTER 19. 215

in Αηη. ΙΙ. 50, cited below, the word being here, as usually, taken in
a restricted sense. Cp. note ch. 6, 11. 11 would seem that her cloak
was torn off and her dress cut at the back. coram propinquis:
ile. the relatives of both husband and wife. Their presence implied
approval of the punishment, and would thus correspond to the actual
trial of the wife before her husband and relatives, who served as
assessors, a procedure often mentioned as an old Roman custom, and
said to have been introduced by Romulus. Cp. Dionys. Halic. Arch.
II. 25 ; Liv. XXXIX. 18. 6 ; Suet. Tib. 35, ancl Tac. Ami. II. 503 XIII.
32. Observe the effective word-order throughout.

12. per omnem vicum: εΙινοιιῃΙι the entire vi'llaye. verbere
agit: cp. the passage in an old law of the Lonibards. publicus . . .
siwia& eas decalvare (z abscisis crinibus) et fuscare per vicos ,· and in
the famous letter of St. Boniface‚ written in 745 Am.. to the Anglo-
Saxon king Ethelbald, we find a very similar statement. ιΤῖαμθῖῖαῐαυι
eant mulieres per pastas . . . ‹luc-mit. rirslis caedentes ec ·i·ae²scimenm
elus abscidentes iuria cinsfulnm . . . ut ceterae timorem adalim-andi
. . . habeant. publicatae enim, etc: enim, with the usual
ellipsis to be supplied. This may 500111 a very severe punishment
for the adulteress, but unz-hasti& when 01100 brouqht to public notice
(in the way described) finds m» piminii a-lmtsoever.

13. pudicitiae: anchus-city, (lismaco, a meaning quite common in
its synonym. pudor. Engl. sleame is equally ambiguous. For a very
bold transference of a positive into its negative, cp. Lucret. V. 1405,
somno (z irunt os sivest).

14. maritum 50. <elium or alterum, as is clear froin the pre-
ceding and the f‹j1ll‹›wing, esp. l. 15 ff. For a similar ellipsis, cp. cli.
10, 153 23, 12: Introd. ΑΨ. p. xxxi. 3. invenerit: 50. adultera.
vitia: vice. ‘

15. conrumpere et conrumpit so joined in Ann. XIV. 20, and
similarly III. 54. conruptus simul et ‹fmzt-icptor. Tacitus often thus
combines the active and the passive of the same verb, eg. Am: 5, 28,
noscere . . . nosci,· Dial. 8, 17, ‹tr-ceperint . . . accipi possit. Cp.
also note ch. 38, 9. saeculum: ilie spirit of the (csse, che way of
the world. In this sense the word does not seem to 000111· elsewhere.
Melius quidem adhuc sc. aqum ‚· are indeed still better off: adhuc:
etiam is often used in post-Augustan Latin to strengthen a comparative.
With the ellipsis of a verb of doing, frequent in Tacitus, cp. e. g. ΑΨ.
19, 27; after melius, as here, eg. Cic. de leq. II. 11, 26; Tac. Anu.
Ι. 43; IV. 38. Tacitus means to say that while the prohibition of a
