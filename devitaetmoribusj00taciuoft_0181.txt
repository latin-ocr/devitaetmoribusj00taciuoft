PAGE 13] No‘rns. CHAPTER 19. 97

19. laureatis z sc. litteris. The laurei, being the symbol of martial
victories, was sent with the official reports which commanders for-
warded to the emperor. —The elliptical phrase seems to occur only
here and Hist. ΙΙΙ. 77.

20. famae famam: for aesimilar chiasmus, cp. Anu. Ι. 39, lessa-
tus populi Romani Romanis ιή castris. aestimantibus, etc. : i.e.
people reasoned that a still greater future was in store for a man who
could be reticent about achievements so noteworthy. —The construc-
tion is probably an elliptical dative rather than an ablat. abs, see note
ch. 34, 30.

21. tam magna: more emphatic than tanta and comparatively
rare. —With the thought, cp. Justin. XI. l, ita moderate (le se multa
pollicitus est, ut adpccrarec plura eum &perimentis reservare, and
Anu. ΙΙ. 22, (ζε se nihil calda, mem invidiae (ιη ratus conscienciam
sacto sacis esse.

Chapter 19. 22. animorum . . . prudens: well acqzcaz'nced with
the temper.

23. doctus per aliena experimenta: musyht by the experz'ence
os others. So Dz'rcl. 34, 16, eruditus· . . . alienis mperz'wnencz's. For
the meaning of eaejvaerz'mencnm, see note ch. 16, 24.

24. excidere: remove, eradicate. Cp. Cic. cle prov. consul. 18,
43, tristissimum tempus . . . era: animo . . . excidere. Surgical
or medical metaphors are comparatively rare in Tacitus and else-
where in Latin, except in Cicero, who had a peculiar fondness for
them.

27. nihil, etc.: sc. ayere. Such ellipses of a verb of doing or
acting, though not unusual, are particularly frequent in Tacitus. Cp.
Introd. p. xxxi. publicae rei: public business. So again Germ.
13, 30. In this sense, the adjective must precede, because res pub-
lica always has its restricted political meaning, but in other combina-
tions with res in Tacitus, the attribute as a rule follows the noun.
See Introd. p. xxvi.

29. ascire sed optimum . . . putare z ascire secl optimum . . .
ascire quia eum . . . putabat. On the prolepsis, see Introd. p. xxx.

30. exsequi: i.e. while he kept himself informed of everything,
he did not always act upon this knowledge. The word, as shown
hypocna below, cannot here signify to punish, a meaning, moreover,
not found elsewhere in Tacitus, though common in Livy. With the
statement itself, cp. Introd. p. xii. 2.
