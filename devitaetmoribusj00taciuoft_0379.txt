an et before ex (or ex after et) is a frequent seribal error. Cp. Drakb.
on Liv. V, 32, 43 and Tae. Dial. 12, 10.

46, 10. et pernicitate] ccc pernicitate. This'is demanded by
consistent Tacitean usage. There are but three polysyndetic members
joined by ec, the last being as usually amplified, usu <zo pernicitate
forming a single, independent group.

46, 14. cubili] cubile — MSS. See note ad loe. and Ζ611111ῑι12 p. 108.

46, 14. spes. The reading of the MSS. seems incompatible with
ch. 46, 23, rem . . . opus esset. I have, therefore, followed Halm 111
aecepting Meiser's easy emendation opes.

46, 24. Oxionas] 10.-1711111113. The name, corrupted in the MSS..
cannot be determined with certainty, 111 spite of Muellenhoff, D. A. II.
354 f.

46, 26. in medio] in medium—MSS. Cp. note ad loc. The
fact that in medio relinquere was the more common expression would
have been a sufficient reason for Tacitus to reJ'ect it. The unanimity
of the MSS„ nioreover, retaining, as they do, the difficilior lectio,
ought also to count for something in this case.
