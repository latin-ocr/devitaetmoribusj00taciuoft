Domitian in his war against the Chatti, and immediately sent as auxil-
iaries to the British legions.

5. magnum ac memorabile: an exceedingly frequent alliterative
collocation, occur-ring as early as Ter. Heaut. 314.

6. facinus: (leod, a so-called vocabulum medium like eventus and
valetudo, the context or some attributive determining whether it is
used in a good or bad sense. Occiso centurione et militibus:
observe the singular predicate with two subJ'ects, the verb usually
preceding in such cases. This is particularly frequent in ablative
absolutes, the predicate here agreeing with the nearer noun. mili-
tibus: sc. leffl'onarz'z‘s. These drill-masters of recruits—the Usipi
had been but recently conscribed—were technically known as <Zoc-
tores campi. and were selected from the most experienced veterans.
Dio Cass. LXVI. ‘20 speaks of the murder of a tribune and centurions.

¹7. exemplum et rectores: the persona] noun joined to the
abstract, on which see Incrod. p. xxxiv.

8. habebantur: urere employed. In this and kindred uses of
habere Tacitus seems to have followed Sallust. liburnicas: sc.
naves, the full form occurring only twice in Tacitus, viz. Hisl. II. 16 3
ΙΙΙ. 12. They were light war vessels, with only two banks of oars,
ancl carried a mast amidships. The pattern, long, narrow, pointed at
both ends, was taken from the Liburnians, a piratical tribe 011 the
coast of Dalmatia.

9. ascendere: the point of departure cannot be determined. It
may have been Uxellodunum, the modern Ellenborough, near Mary-
port, 011 the Cnlnberland coast, or more probably Galloway. See map.

10. nondum vulgato rumore. etc.: 10. the news of their defec-
tion had not yet spread, so that those who saw them were at a loss
to understand either their sudden appearance or their (lestination.

11. praevehebantur: Tacitus elsewhere uses prae for praeter in
this and similar verbal conipounds, but here it is perhaps best taken
in its regular sense, signifying their helpless drifting along, the want
of pilots placing them at the mercy of wind and wave.

12. utilia: sc. cetera, other necessarz'es of life. On the ellipsis,
see note ch. 6, 29.

15. vescerentur: with the accusative, like ικίιηρον (Anu. III. 2),
potz'or (Ana. XI. 10), is rare and archaic, but found eg. Sall. Hisc.
,ἴνα-(11η. 25 K. and Tib. ΙΙ. 5, 64.

16. circumvecti: Dio Cass. 10. makes them sail around Britain
from east to west, thus excluding their reaching the continent.
