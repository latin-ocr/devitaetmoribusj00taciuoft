CRITICAL APPENDIX To
THE AGRICOLA.

THE deviations from the text of Halm4 here noted follow the
bracket.— O. R. refers to my Notos to the Agricola in the Classical
Bet-imo, vol. XI. (1897), pp. 325-:332.—F. to'Furneaux’s edition,
Oxford, 1898.—A(r) Ξ Vat. 34292 13(A): Vat. 4498.

Chapter 3, line 12. set] et-Msst See F. ad loc.

4, 16. ultra quam] ultraque qnam—Baehrens. Cp. O. R. 325.

4, 17. ac senatori] <ac senators). Cp. Ο. R. 325. Amlresen (and
F. is disposed to agree with him) has objected to this deletion on the
ground that senatori may be taken in an anticipatory sense, as in Dial.
28, 3, principes liberos (destined to be leaders) and Ann. III. 59, reo-
torem [seueris humani (the future ruler). This explanation would be
acceptable if the text read ccc consuli, expressive of the highest attain-
able goal, as in the examples just cited ; but to reach senatorial rank
was certainly no conspicuous achievenlent, and its mention immedi-
ately upon Romano is in the nature of an anti-climax.

6, 18. 20. pro consule . . . pro consule] proconsulem . . .
proconsul.

6, 27. tenor] † cercior—MSS. No satisfactory emendation of this
admittedly corrupt reading has yet been proposed. Tener (Rhenae
nus) gives a tolerable sense, but it is paleographically out of the ques-
tion, and the word does not occur elsewhere in Tacitus. Cp. Ο. R.
325.

6, 29. medio rationis] medio moderationis. Cp. QR. 326.

6, 2. effecit] fecit—MSS. Cp. Cic. in I'err. V. 2, 53 ovid, ex
Pone. Ι. l, 65.

8, 23. dignum est : Tacitus elsewhere omits the copula after (liq-
num and z‘ndigsnum. See O. 13:326. Ι have now retained it with the
MSS. because the ellipsis of the copula had not yet reached the pro-
portions it had in the later writings. See Introd. p. xxxii. Possibly
also, as Andr-esen suggests, it. may have been here designedly expressed
to prevent erac froin being understood.
