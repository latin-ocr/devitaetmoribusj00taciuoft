sources. Thus no distinction is made between winter and summer
apparel (cp. note ch. 46, 13); nor is it reasonable to believe that Ger-
man garments presented such uniformity as is here implied, a suppo-
sition confirmed by numerous discrepancies in other writers, such as
Caesar, for these cannot all have been due to actual changes intro-
duced between his time and that oi* the author to whom Tacitus owes
his information.

Chapter 18. The marriage customs of the Germans, dealt with in
this and the following chapter, seem to have excited the genuine admi-
ration of Tacitus, and 111 consequence the description is again stylisti-
cally elaborated, a feature foreshadowed by laudaveris. This rhetorical
coloring is due chiefly to the following elements: anaphora (ll. 28 f..
30. 32 f. 1 f. 3: 19, 6 f. 13. 18 f. 19); clzlasmas (l. 22); epanalepsis
(l. 2433 lihralz'on (l. 28. 30. 32 f. 1 f. 3; 19, 18 f. 20); (illicet-acite
antithesis (19, 22 f.); effective *at-ord order (l. 32, 13 19, 6 f. 10 f.);
epifflammale'c paine (19, 14 f. 22 f.); rhythmical clausula (see note
Aqr. ch. 30, 12); l. 22. ⁵29. 1. 5; 19, 10. 15. 133. Observe also the con-
trast with Roman customs emphasized throughout.

18. Quamquam: in spite of eliis, for the last clause might easily
have suggested laxity of morals. In rejecting this possible impression
as erroneous, Tacitus at the same time skilfully establishes a transitiOn
to the discussion of marriage customs. chanzquam in an independent
principa] clause occurs in Tacitus only here, Dz'al. 28, 14 ; 33, 6; and
in one passage of the second part of the Annals (XII. 65), in which
he often returns to his earlier usage.

19. laudaveris: potential subjunctive. prope soli barba-
rorum: the Gauls and Iberians being among the exceptions which
Tacitus may have had 111 111111(1. Concubinage seems, however, to
have been permitted.

characteristic of 'l'aeitean style. Cp. Introd. p. lxx. Translate: noc
