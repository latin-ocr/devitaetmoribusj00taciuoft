PREFACE.

WEx’s edition of the A (frivola (1852) may be said to constitute
a new landmark in the philological labors devoted to the elucida-
tion of this biography. He incorporated what was still of value
in the work of his numerous predecessors, and added not a little
of his own to the improvement of the text and to a better under-
standing of its contents. Since his time the contrilmtious made
to the criticism and exegesis of the A yrieola, and to Tacitus gen-
erally, have been very considerable, both in quality and quantity3
but While the historical, ethnological, and syntactical material
thus accumulated is satisfactorily exhaustive, the strictly rhetorical
features of the Ayfiwlu, conspicuous though they are, have hitherto
been persistently and inexplicably overlooked or ignored. And
yet it must be evident that a student can at best acquire but a
very superficial appreciation of the consunnnate artistic merits ot
this treatise if he remain in ignorance of the vital elements that
make the Agyrz'colcz the imniortal masterpiece that it is.

I have, therefore, been at pains to illustrate and analyze, albeit
under the restrictions necessarily imposed upon a college edition,
all noteworthy rhetorical features in the style and structure of the
Ayricola, the synopsis in the Introduction being, for the reason
given above, intentionally more full than might otherwise appear
warranted in an edition of this nature. The discovery that Taci-
tus, in writing the Agyrio-ola, closely followed time-honored rhetori-
cal canons for biographical composition was as great a surprise to
me, who had once denied this on the basis ot' an examination of
extant classica] biographies, as it will doubtless be to others. 1
hope, however, that the necessarily brief review of the evidence
given in the Introduction will suffice to carry conviction.

In the Notes I have endeavored to face every real difficulty and
to omit no comment, wherever such would be welcome to the
young student, and Ι trust that no wholly irrelevant matter has
