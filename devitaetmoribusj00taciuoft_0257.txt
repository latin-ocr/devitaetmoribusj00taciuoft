cherries, and pears, are borrowed from the Latin, none ot' these being

probably the domesticv animals, exclusive of cats and dogs.

17. plerumque : frequently. This weakened sense, of the word is

much the more common in 'l'aeitus improcera: 30. pecora swat,

styles them prat-(c and insin-misc, but says they possessed great endur-

18. suus honor : their peculim beauty, such as Tacitus was accus-
tomed to see in Italian kine. Cp. also Verg. Georgs. 111. 51. gloria

gold were not found 111 any appreciable quantities. The statement is

20. Neo tamen, etc: only apparently contradicts solae . . . opes,
the implication being that even if these metals did occur, they were
