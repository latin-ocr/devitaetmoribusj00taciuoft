into afamz'lz'a urbana and rustica, and these. in turn. subdivided into
ordinarii and valam-es. soluti and vincti. each of whom had his spe-
cial duties. Cp. esp. Petron. 30. unns eaepzcerz's qui snper hoc officinm

ch. 15, 8. The condition of these dependent village communit-ies is
doubtless idealized.

2. Frumenti : (st-ain. as in ch. 23. 12. These taxes were a kind of
substitute for rent. and are still met with in later times.

3. vestis: eloth. which was woven on the premises. ut colono:
our detailed knowledge concerning the status of the Roman colamus
begins with the 4th century Aa). At this period, and later, he pre-
sents many points of analogy with the conditions here described. Cp.
esp. Cod. ›Iustz'm XI. 51. licet ‹xvmlzcione =rideantur instemus, servi m«

however, he was a free lessee οἱ property under a contrad. the rent
being paid in kind. The term serras is. therefore. misapplied. See
following note. hactenus paret sc. domino. This is again at
variance with later conditions. for the German serf had no legal rights,
but was considered as a mere chattel. which passed on with the sale of
the property. For hactenus in its strictly local sense. see ch. 35. 1.

4. cetera domus officia: the cooking. baking, brewing. etc.. as
distinguished from the labors in the field just mentioned. On this
idiomatic use of cetera (for the (tyrorum officia were not part of the
domus officia). cp. e.g. Hisc. III. 123 IV. :363 Amz. III. 42 ; Liv.V11.

corresponding to ch. 15, 8. infirmissimo czcz'que exfamz'lz'a ‚· but Tacitus
probably wrote liberti. See Critical Appendix.

5. verberare servum . . . rarum: in contras-t with the cruel
punishment inflicted on Roman slaves. often on the slightest occasion.
