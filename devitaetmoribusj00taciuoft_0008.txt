been allowed to intrude. In not burdening the commentary with
scrupulous acknondedgrnent for every real obfigathn] incurred‚
imperative as this would be in an edition intended for scholars, I
have ventui-ed to follow a well-recognized precedent. Nor have
Ι, for reasons of brevity, called attention, except in a few instances‚
to the existence of other interpretations than those, whether new
or old, which Ι deemed sufficiently convincing to war-rant accept
ance. Under these circumstances Ι gladly take this opportunity
of saying that, of all the editions accessible to me, Ι have found
those of lVex, Peter, Andresen, and Fnrneaux especially helpful
and suggestive3 and Ι only regret that, having profited so much
by their labors, 1 should have been compelled to dissent from
their views so frequently, though Ι hope never without valid
reasons. <rhan I have again 1nade every possflsse use of the ad-
mirable Lexico'n Taciteum, unfortunately not yet finished‚ will be
evident from my Notes.

The text has been subjected to a thorough revision, and may
claim to represent an independent recension. It differs from that
of Halm⁴¹ in nearly sixty instances‚ the justificatior] of these devia-
tions being given, as briefly as possible, in a Critical Appendix.
It is a 1natter of great regret that l had to be deprived of the
benefit which the third known Ms. of the A micola, discovered by
Dr. R. quensch in Toledo‚ might have proved to be for the con-
stitution of a better text than is now possible. But the most
strenuous efforts to secure a copy, photograph, 01· collation have
been alike mravaililig, owing to the unfortunate attitude of the
prelate of ToledO, who, though incapable of reading the Ms.
himself, has absolutely prohibited its inspection‚ on the ground
that a Ms. once made known loses all its value.

In conclusion, Ι have again the pleasure of acknowledging with
gratitude the most welcome and valuable aid which my old friends.
Professor John C. Rolfe of the University of Michigan and Pro-
fessor Charles Ε. Bennett of Cornell University, have so ungrudg-
ingly given to this book in its passage through the press.
