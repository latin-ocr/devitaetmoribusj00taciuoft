The imperfect is here used for the pluperfect, because the Roman
principle of completely suhjugating what was in reach still held good.
inventus: sc. crat, not esset, for, although the subjunctive of esse is
frequently ‹nnitted‚ when another subjunctive has preceded (cp.
Intimi. p. xxxii), the rhetorical use. of the indicative in the apodosis
of conditional clauses contrary to fact is one of the characteristic fea-
tures of Tacitean syntax. llere it marks an emphatic ciimtrast to the
unreality of the protasis, which in all like instances, except lIi'st. IV.
19, precedes.

28. Clota et Bodotria: the Friths of C'lyde and Fortia, the line
itselt' stretching approximately froin Grecnoclc (near Glasgow) to
Eilz'nhim·[slt. diversi: opposite. See note ch. 11, ὅ. per in-
mensum :pen mammon spatium. Such expressions are exceedingly
common in Tacitus. See note ch. 10„ 13.

29. spatio: strip. About 70 miles.

30. omnis propior sinus : [lie misire stretclz of terrimo-gs nemer to
ηε. ie. the southern [untions previously occupied by the Romans.
For a similar meaning- of sinus, here including the west coast and part
of the interior, cp. Germ. 337, 215.

31. velut iu aliam insulam z aliam skillfnlly marks the transition
to the next chapter, dealing with lreland. It' Caledonia had been
meant here, Tacitus would have said velut in insulan-12. With firmam'c
and tenebatur the author indicates that the Caledonian campaign in
the west was satisfactorily closed. and7 as a matter of fact, the subse-
quent scene of the conflict is shifted to the east.

Chapter 24. 32. Quinto . . . anno: 82 ⁴mn. nave prima
transgressus: crossillgy over (viz. to Ireland) far [lie first time with
(cflcet. If, as is generally assumed, the fieet coasted northward along
the shore, transssressns would be out of place. Prima is here, as
often, eg. Germ. 4³3, 5, used adverbially, and its position. while
bringing it in juxtaposition with the verb, at the same time empha-
sizes the significance of the achievement. The name Ireland occurs,
first in Pytheas ; Caes. B. G. 3, 2, also mentions the island, and sub-
sequently many references to it, often Cill·iOUS‚ occur. but it cannot
be said to have been definitely known till the time of Ptolemaeus, the
famous geographer of the second century tei». Agricola. if we except
occasional traders. seems to have been, in fact. the first Roman to set
foot upon Irehmd, nor was it again invaded in Roman times. The
point of departure cannot be accurately determinesl. See map.
