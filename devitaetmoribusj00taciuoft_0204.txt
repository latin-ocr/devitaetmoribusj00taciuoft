120 No'rsss. CHAPTER 3:2¹. [rma 21

ch. 29, 10), although its contents teeni with rhetorical common-
places, met with in similar productions of Thucydides (esp. books
VI.—V[I.), Sallust, Livy, Curtius, and Ammianus Marcellinus. Cp.
also Introd. p. xv. f. —The most notevvorthy rhetorical features are:
anaphora (ch. 33, 2. 11; 34, 25. 20 f.); asyndeton (ch. 33, 1 ff. 6.
143 35, 5) ; antithesis (ch. 33, 5. 13. 15 f. 17); fullness of eaepression
(ch. 33, 2 1. 7. 9 1.; 34, 24. 3. 4); libracz'oa (ch. 33, 3 f. 6. 7. 13.
14. 21; 34, 26. 5 1.) ; poetic aad epissranmnatc'c estpressz'ons (ch. 33,
10 ff. 13. 15 f. 20 1. 22; 34, 29. 30 ff 3. 5 f.); dierat-haic clausula
(ch. 33, 2. 8. 0. 11. 21. 23, 34, 25. 26. 28. 31. 5. 3) ; cretio clausula

(oh. 34, 8).
25. barbaris: cp. Hz‘st. IV. 15, oizaqno cum adsensu auditus,
barbaro rica. moris: so ch. 39, 5; 42, 23, and elsewhere in Taci-

tus. It seems to occur first in Cic. Vei-r. Ι. 26, 66. The 111016 usual
mos est, eg. ch. 25, 1 ; 40, 12.

26. cantu fremituque et clamoribus: the same collocation
(que—ec), eg. ch. 32, 10 f.; 33, 9 1., similar synonymic combinations
being exceedingly common.

27. fulgores ε sc. adspz'ce'ebantnr. On the ellipsis of a verb of see-
ing, cp. Anu. Ι. 7, ne laeti . . . tristiores (sc. aaspz'eerencur), and
Iam-od. p. xxxi. —The plural of ι11111101· is very rare, and was probably
due to aymina. Translate: Marchizzss 6011011113, each with flaslzz'ny
arms, were seen. audentissimi : the substantival use of audens is
Vergilian, and not uncommon in later poetry, but in prose not before
Tacitus, the superlative being apparently ἅπαξ εἰρημένοι). procursu:
the ablative of ‘ attendant circumstance' is particularly frequent in
Tacitus. Cp. Dial. 39, 25, com'nrsa tollas ciuitatis.

28. simul . . . cum: izo sooner . . . thc‘m. This correlation
seems to be extremely rare, so eg. Liv. XLIV. 43, 1. It is not found
elsewhere in Tacitus, though 111111, iamque . . . cum is one of his
favorite combinations, quamquam: with adjective, as 111 ch. 1, 2,
where see note.

29. coercitum: the perfect passive participle here takes the place
of a missing adjective in -ὸῖίίε, So often, eg. Sall. Izcgl. 43, 5, animam
invictum.

30. adhuc: still further. Cp. note ch. 29, 6. septimus annus,
eto. : wls-84, after the Roman method, reckoned inclusively. This
seems to have been a stereotyped exordium. Cp. eg. Hist. I. 28;
Ana. XIV. 53; Lucan, I. 299, and Liv. XXI. 40, 5. 43, 13, the
speeohes of Hannibal and Scipio furnishing coincidences throughout.
