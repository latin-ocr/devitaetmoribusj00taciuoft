See note eh. 9, 28. The difficulty would be solved, ii we supposed
that here, and in Anu. XIII. 57, lie was following different sources.
Reqnator is exceedingly common in poetry, but is found in prose
only here; but reynairix, also as an adjective, occurs Ami. Ι. 4.
Cp. note ch. 14, 29. Omnium: omnium rerum. Cp. 45, 8. So
often in Tacitus. See notes Dial. 19, 8; Am·- 41, 1.

22. Adicit auctoritatem: sc. nobilitatis, i.e. lends color 10 their
claim of being nobilissimi, a much weaker expression than fides . . .
firmatur above, where see note. centum pagis habitant: the
same statement is made of the Suebi in general by Caes Β. G. 1. :375
3; IV. 1, 4. It seems to have been a stereotyped formula to desig-
nate a populous tribe. With the intransitive use of habitare. cp. Anu.
ΙΙ. 60 ; IV. 65.

23. corpore: msultitwle. So often. In Tacitus, again, Hisc. IV.
64. Cp. our a ‘body of men.' Here the term was probably suggested
by caput.

24. caput: atilae head. (Ἰ). Hist. I. 5. 84; IV. 69. The entire
phrase is a mere variation of nobilissimos . . . memorant.

this treatise only the Langobardi, Anglii (ch. 40. 28), and Gotones
(ch. 44, 7) were destined to play an important role in later European
history. The Langobardi are first mentioned by Vell. Pat. ΙΙ. 106. 2.
as having been defeated by Tiberius. They subsequently revolted
from Maroboduus and joined the Cherusci under Arminius. In the
5th century. over-population seems to have led to their migration
from the regions of the lower Elbe, and in 568 they founded the famous
Lombard kingdom in upper Italy, which lasted till the time of Charles
the Great. The etymology, as of almost all German tribal names, is
doubtful, some interpreting -barcl as heard, others as acres, the latter
being not improbable. The modern village, Bardowieclt, near Liine-
burg, is supposed to preserve the name. paucitas nobilitat: i.e.
as contrasted with the multitude of the Semnones, and showing at the
same time that mere numerica] strength, upon which the Semnones
based their claim to nob'ilitas, is not sufficient to prove this. See note
above, ch. 39, 12. plurimis . . . cincti: Tacitus' infsmnation
concerning the location and characteristics of these northern and
northwestern tribes was of the vaguest description; the. present
phrase must, therefore, not be too closely pressed. Among the
