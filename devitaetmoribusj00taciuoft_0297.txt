clauses clearly do not allow us to refer ria-endum to c‘n pace, and
pereundum to in proelio. accipere se: sc. arma. The relative
agrees with only a part of the composite antecedent (here the last
mentioned), boves and equus being, of course, excluded as possible
obJ'ects to be handed down to future generations. On this usage,
cp. note ch. 2, 3 ; and for an English example, see Huc‘s Travels in

sons, partly because l. 27 f. implies that the daughters were not
excluded from this inheritance. The incongruity is due either to a
striving for rhetorical conciseness or to the fact that women were not
generally allowed to inherit. Cp. note to ch. 20, ῦΗ chae is also
used ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, as the object of accipiant and the subject of reiciantur.

favor the first translation, while liberis-sons, may be urged on behalf
of the second.
