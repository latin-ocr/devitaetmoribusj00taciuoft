iu Tacitus. virtus: εὐγένεια, blm> blood. A bold personification 3
i.e. vinus, like a father, acknowledges the inqenui as her legitimate
offspring, aclynosoere being the technical legal term for this recogni-
tion. Sera . . . venus: they marry late. The fact is attested by
Caes. B. (τ’. VI. 21. 4, qui diutissime impuberes permanserunt maximam
inter suos jerunt landem, etc, and Pomp. Mela ΙΙΙ. 3, 26, lonqissz'ma
apud eos puericia est.

30. inexhausta : a Vergiliau word (Aen. X. 174), in Tacitus again
Hisc. V. 7, but apparently not elsewhere 111 prose.

31. festinantur: hurried 1711εο marriaye, i.e. in contrast with
Roman custom, on which see note Ayr. 9, 28. iuventa, poetic and
post-Augustali for iuventus. With the collocation, cp. ch. 28, 183
ΑΨ, 16, 1 ; Ann. ΙΙ. 25. eadem virtute, pari ferocia.

32. pares validaeque :pares aetate aa pariter validae, 111 most
striking contrast with Roman custom. miscentur: marry, like
the Homeric μιὙῆναι.

Page 43. 1. referunt: in turn exlzz'bz't, reprodnce. So very fre-
quent in poetry, but comparatively rare 111 prose. Cp. eg. Lucret.
IV. 1210; Verg. Georffi 111. 128, invalidique patrum referant Ieiunia
nati; Plin. Epist. V. 16, 9, and ch. 43. 13. Sororum filiis, etc. ι
this statement probably reflects polyandrous conditions of society in
which desceut passed through the female line, the so-called Manem-echi
(mother rz'yht). Engl. nephew, Germ. neffe, derived from nepos,
§rand-son, and the Latin avunculus (uncle ou the mother's side), seem
to point to the same intimate relationship. The omission of sororum
· filiae is strange, in view oi' what is said of the preference for girls as
hostages in ch. 8, 19 f., but girls passed into the tutelage of their
brothers. In case there were no sons, the avunculus or patruus
would, 111 311 probability, step in as guardian. Tacitus often refers to
this Germanic peculiarity, e.g. Hisc. IV. 33; V. 203 Ami. XII. 29.
apud . . . apud: on the repetition of the preposition, see Introd-
p. lxvii.

2. Quidam: i.e. quaedam Germanorum flentes.

4. exigunt sc. hunc nemum, i.e. sororum filios vel filias, a princi-
ple which the Roman conquerors did not fail to adopt. Cp. Suet.
Oetae. 21 (cited note ch. 8, 20). tamquam : ἰῗη the conviccz'on chat.
On these substantive clauses, cp. note ch. 12, 22. animum, etc..· take
