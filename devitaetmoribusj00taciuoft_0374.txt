psychologically incredible that a man of Tacitns' rank, insight, and
disposition should have serionsly advised his countrymen that the best
way to subdue their old enemy would be 10 311111 11 11661 brewery, with

grotesque and absurdly impracticable scheme constitutes the only
policy which the great historian venture-d to suggest in the entire
treatise - 11 treatise which many scholars, albeit erroneonsly, regard
as a political pamphlet, primarily designed for Trajan and directed
against Roman jingoes! (5) Finally the pointed phrase, lamed . . .
vincentur, is, quite unlike the numerous other epigrammatic expressions
of this author, not only utterly inappropriate, because demonstrably
false, bnt it also bears a suspicions resemblance to Justin I. 8, 7, prius
Scythae ebrietate quam bello vincuntur, where the sentiment is, how-
ever, in perfect keeping with the context and not open to any of the
objections above referred to; but Tacitus was not in the habit of
borrowing epigrams or of misapplying those of others. The entire
passage is clearly a marginal note of some ancient reader which sub-

I am, therefore, strongly inclined 1ο believe that Tacitus wrote liberti.
This would also at once account for the statement made immediately
below, liberti non multum supra servos sunt, for Tacitus had pre—
