196 NOTEs. CHAPTER 12. [PAGE 38

18. poenarum: death pensatio& See below diversitas supplicii.
Other crimes, though not belonging to leviora delleta. and not punished
by death, are here ignored, Tacitus having in mind only those com-
mitted against the community as such. ex delicto : improporcz'on to
che character ns the Qffenee. Proditores et transfugas: these terms
and desertor are naturally often combined, eg. Hi'st. Ι. 72; IV. 58;
Ana. 11. 10; IV. 48. They are not synonymous, transm-(lium and
desertio being often only distinct manifestations of proditio. It has
frequently been maintained that Tacitus has here been inconsistent
with his statements in 611. 6, 25, and 14, 20, concerning the infamy
attaching to ‹imorem-3, but he is there speaking only of men who would
be beyond tlze reach of che law. Deserticn, like other acts of treason,
was punishable by death in the laws of Charles the Great, and has
remained a capital offence down to the present time.

19. arboribus suspendunt: as this was the official mode of exe—
cution for traitors, it may explain in a measure the reason why some
deserters, mentioned in ch. (ὅ, 25, committed suicide by Ῐιαηῃίηῃ.
ignavos et imbelles: a not uncommon collocation, but of varied
meaning. Cp. Liv. XXVI. 2, 11, ianam? et imbelles inter hostis essens&
Agsr. 15, 26, merely by way of reproach. 111 Germ. 31, 16, it stands
for those physically weak and unfit for war. Here the phrase implies
an overt act ot' cowardice and may include deserters who were caught
in the attempt. According to Norse law, the coward in battle could
be killed on the spot.

20. corpore infames: the three elements in this enumeration are
emphasized by polysyndeton and alliteration, the last member being
amplified. Cp. Introd. p. lxvii. The same phrase occurs in Ann. Ι. 73,
and refers to unnatural vices, an instance being recorded among the
Batavians by Tacitus himself, in Hisc. IV. 14. caeno . . . mer-
gunt: this 15 abundantly attested for much later times. Cp. the
northern epic, Gothrumnsz'ffim 111. 10, they led {lie woman into α
som szcczmp. In East Frisia, in 1817, a female skeleton, bound with
wickerwork, was found 111 the depths of a moor. This mode of
punishment, though not for the last-named offence, was also practised
by the PersianS, and the Carthaginians, and was not unknown to the
early Romans. Cp. Herod. VII. 1143 Xen. Anab. Ι. 6, 11 (the death
of Orontas) ; Plaut. Poen. V. 2, 65 (vs, 1025), snb cratim ut iubeas se
