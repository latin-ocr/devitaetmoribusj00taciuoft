rios 3] NOTES. CHAPTER 11. 83

9. habitum: sc. eicndcm. On the ellipsis of the demonstrative
pronoun, see note 611. 6, 19. In universum . . . aestimanti: but
on a (lauerat consideration. The so-called dative 01 1116 person judg-
ing. Cp. Germ. 6, 16, in universum aestimanti. Cp. note 611. 10, 13.

11. Eorum: sc. Gallorum. deprehendas: sc. apud Britannos.
To one ignorant of their common origin the coincidence would be
surprising. On the force of this verb, see note ch. 7, 10, and on 1116
collocatio verboram, characteristic of Tacitus, see Introd. p. xxvi.
superstitionum persuasiones: retiatores convz'cttons, cult. Pcr-
snasz'o is very rarely found 111 the plural. Caesar, while confirming
the identity 01 1116 cult, asserts, in apparent contradiction to Tacitus,
that it originated in Britain and was adopted by the Gauls. Cp. B. (τ’.
VI. 13, 11 f. Disciplina (sc. Druidum) in Britannia reperta atque
inde in Galliam translata esse ci‘z'stz'matur et nnnc qni ‹Iz'lz'ssmztins eam
rem coynosccre colunt, plerumque illo descendi causa proficiscuntur.
The truth seems to be that the ritual was originally Celtic, but, owing
to the isolation of the Britisli 06113, was by them developed on more
rigid and orthodox lines.

12. sermo . . . diversus: of the two great branches of the
Celtic language in the British islands, the Goidelic or Q Celts and
1116 Brythonic Or P Celts, we must probably look to the latter, repre—
sented by Welsh, Breton, and Cornish, as exhibiting 1116 greater simi-
larity with the Gallie tongue, but the ancients did not advance beyond
a merely perfunctory observation of liuguistic phenoniena, and there-
fore little or no reliance can be placed upon their statenients in such
matters. in deposcendis . . . formido: observe the artistic
balancing of clauses. ——With the statement, cp. Caes. BG. III. 19, 6.
ut ad bella suscipienda Gallorum alacer ac promptus est animus, sic
mollis ac minime resistens aa calamitates perferendas mens eorum est.

13. ubi advenere: sc. pericula.

14. praeierunt : for the more usual prae seferre‚ so ch. 43, 12.

15. pax emollierit: on the enervating effect of peace upon a
savage people, see ch. 21, 25 ff, and esp. Germ. 14, 24, εἰ civitas . . .
lonfsa pace et otio torpeat. Nam: like enim, γάρ, with the usual
ellipsis to be supplied in thought. Le. this may be confirmed by the
example of the Gauls, for the-y, etc.

16. accepimus: esp. Caes. Ra. VI. 24, fuit antea tempus cum
Germanos Galli virtute superarent, cited Germ. 28, 5.

with two subjects, especially common 111 ablative absolute construc-
