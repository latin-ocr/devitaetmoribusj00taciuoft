Tacitus wholly ignores the Buryodiones, Charini, S'nsflszbre‘,
and knows of but one qens Chaucorum.

{ut it is upon the description of amber (eh. 45) that
Taeitean indebtedness to l'liny’s eneyelopaedia is alleged to
rest most securely, for the latter devotes no fewer than
sixteen paragraphs to this very subject (N. II. XXXVII. 2,
11, 30-46). his very enumeration of the many authors who
dealt with the origin and provenanee of amber showing
clearly, as may be observed 111 passing, that an extensive
literature eoneerning this substance existed before Pliny's
time. Now, it is certainly not without signifieanee that the
one noteworthy agreeinent¹ between him and Tacitus (for
the other eoineidenees of statement pertain to details of
unquestionably eommon knowledge and observation) is
expressly cited as a fact known to prisci nostri. On the
other hand, Tacitus gives a number of details not found in
Pliny. Thus the former conspicuously mentions the Aestii
as engaged in the ambei- trade, and speaks only of the Baltio
Sea3 the latter says nothing of this tribe, and refers only
to the shores of the North Sea as the region where the
amber came from.2

If any further proof of Taeitus' independenee of Pliny
were needed, it would be furuished by their widely dis-
crepant and irreeoneilable deseriptions of the Chauci& Pliny
pietures them as living in sordid poverty and devoid of all

wrote Suionibus· (mentioned by T. immediately after his account of
amber) instead of (r'ul'om'lms, an otherwise wholly unknown name
which he cites from Pytheas.
