Pion 57] ΝΟΤΕ3. CHAPTER 46. 285

17. aliud . . . contegantur: this, whether true or false, is also
only applicable to the summer 3033011. Τ110 passage seems 10 be 311
echo of Lucret. V. 955 ft, (favosque montis silvasque colebant Ec
frutices inter condebant squalida membra Verbera ventorum vitare
imbrisque coactz·; 97011, membra Nuda dabant termo . . . Cirr-mn se
foliis ccc frondibus involventes ,· 982 ff., saecla ferarmn Infestam
miseris faciebant saepe quietem . . . Intempesta cedebant nocte pa-
ventes Hospz'cz'bus saevis instrata cubilia fronde. ferarum imbri-
umque: objective genitives. Cp. Plin. Epist. IX. 39, 2, ει([ῗ“1ι[]ι“ηηι
aut imbris ant solis,· Ann. IV. 66, malorum suffussiwn ; and note ch.
16, 30, where rece2,)tcc‹·ulnm is also used with svffuqinm.

18. aliquo z quodam, as in Dz'al. 39, 10, aleonis oratorum campus.
ramorum, eto: with the statement, cp. Herod. IV. 23 ὑπὸ δενδρέῳ δὲ
ἕκαστος κατοίκηται (sc. the Scythian Argippaeans). Similar huts,
made 01 birch bark, are found eg. among the Karagassians of Siberia
and the Laplanders, but only in summer.

19. senum receptaculum: i.e. as no longer capable of hunting.

20. beatius arbitrantur: i.e. sie se b. virere (ι. ingemere
agris z (seniore in ayt-is. Cp. Lucret. V. 209, bidenti Inyeonere ,· Verg.
Geom. I. 45, (aratro infirmiore ,· Hor. Epod. V. 31, inssemens laboribus.
The dative after compound verbs is in poetry and post-Augustali prose
frequently used 111 3 local sense; so (tyris, domibus here. Cp. also
ch. 10, 7 ; 27, :283 45, 23. . '

21. inlaborare domibus z laborare in domibus, to work indoors.
The usual interpretation 10 labor orer house-bundinqs is out of place
after what has preceded, and is based upon the non-recognition of the
local use of the dative. The verb is a word coined by Tacitus for 1110
purpose of balancing the clause with z'nyemere astris. Cp. 11010 ch.
16, 30. Probably the latter refers more particularly to men, inlabo-
rare domibus to women 3 at least, Procopius expressly states 11131 1110
Finnish women do 110 housework, that they hang their children wrapped
in skins in trees, and then go huuting with the men. suas, ete. :
they do not handle wealth, either their own or chat of oclzserS, i.e. they
engage in 110 0011111101·0131 or finaucial transactions. spe metuque:
i.e. amid hope of gain and secar of loss, they are not worried, 33 they
take 110 risks either way.

22. securi, etc. z unconcerned. This probably contains a final hit
at Roman conditions. Having no wealth, the Penni do not, like the
Romans, attract legacy-hunters or the covetousness of the emperor, nor
do they excite the envy of the deity.
