Germans in general, for their religion was certainly not a mere nature-
worship. It may, however, 111 Caesar's time, have been partly appli-

by them fron] the Gauls. This hypothesis would, at least, in 11 11161131116
account for the eurious mixture still survix'ing in names for the week.

concessis animalibus: it seems that only those domestic animals
which were eatable were included in this class3 those sacred to par-
ticular deities, however, such as the 111111 111 the case of Mars (Tiu),
or the boar, in that of Hercules (Donar), were not sacrificed. Pars

Tacitus, the Suebic race was by far the most widely diffusoed of all
Germanic peoples (see ch. 38 ff.) 3 but, as a goddess Nehalennia was
worshipped with similar rites hythe Suebic branch which Augustus
transplanted to Flanders from the upper Rhine and Danube. it is not
improbable that she represents the Isis of Tacitus.

29. Isidi: this is not an instance of incemremtzffo Romana, for the
antiquarians consulted by Tacitus did not, as elsewhere, identify the
German cult with a Roman one on the basis of similar attributes, but
in this case assumed direct importation, because they fancied that the
carrying of a ship's symbol in procession in spring and the mci-z'ssz‘nm
Isidis, on March 5th, constituted an external resemblance too striking
to admit of an independent, native origin¹ unde: 36. esset. (111

dative with ονίῃο, causa, initium is extremely common in Tacitus.

his entire satisfaction, whence the movement for the importation of
this cult (unde cansa) arose and through whose or what agency (orz’qo)
it was transplanted. nisi quod qualifies parum comperi ancl voices
the conviction that this cult was in any case not indigenous like the
other Germanic rites, but clearly foreign. That the sanie ceremony
