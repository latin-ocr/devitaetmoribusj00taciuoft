have been small, they were assigned to certain older leaders for pur-
00565 of training. Robustc'or, in the sense of mature, is quite common.

synonym of iam pridem probatis, used in reference to the time when
ciricus suffecturum probaverit (1. 32). On the ellipsis of sed, see
Introzl. p, lxvii.

11. Haec dignitas, hae vires: the pronouns here refer 10 what
follows ;¹above, l. 2 f., 10 what precedes. magno . . . circumdari:
this clause is placed between haec . . . vires and ῖη . . . praesidium, as
belonging equally to both, decus referring more particularly to (liqui-
tas, praesidium to efres. Cp. note ch. 2, 1. On the statement itself,
