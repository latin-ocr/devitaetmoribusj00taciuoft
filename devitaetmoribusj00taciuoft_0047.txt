THE PURPOSE oF THE GERMANIA. xli

simple virtues, thus accentuating by contrast the vices 01
civilized Rome.

As regards the idealization 01 Germanic traits and 0115-
101115,1 it must be observed, not only that it is at best inci-
dental, but that a similar attitude is shared by the ancients
generally, who from Homer down have thrown a halo 01 111-
110001100 and rectitnde about the remote people 01 the North,
for distance has always lent enehantment to the view and
omne igynotmn pro masym’fico. Now to a man like Tacitus
who, dissatisfied with the conditions in which his lot was
cast, longed to dwell in the ‘good old times,⁷ these sturdy,
vigorous Germans naturally came to serve as a welcome
background 101· 1115 pessiniistic reflections. The resultant
contrasts, 50 disparaging to the society 01 1115 day, were thus
partly the natural outcome 01 the subject-matter as such,
partly the reflection 01 those convictione and feelings which
give to all 01 the author's writings that distinctive character
and individuality which we designate as Τ1101101111.2

But while the view maintaining the ethical or satirica]
purpose 01 the Germania has now been all bnt universally
abandoned, another hypothesis, though without a scintilla
01 evidence and objectionable on many grounds, has been
and still is tenaciously held by numerous scholars 01 repute.3

name as apocryphal, and hence the occurrence of these peculiarly
Tacitean features in the Dialogsus constitutes 0110 of the many irre—

or three advocates 01 its spuriousness persistently ignore.
