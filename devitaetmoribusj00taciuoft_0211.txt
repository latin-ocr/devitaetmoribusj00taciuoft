9. semineces for semivivos is a Vergilian word, frequent in post-
Augustan poetry, but very rare in prose, eg. Liv. XXIII. 15, 8 and
Tac. Hz'st. III. 28. In Greek. 011 the other hand, the very opposite

with certainty, the meaning seems to have been that the Roman
cavalry, following up the successes of the infantry, were equally im-

conflict only partially resembled the equestrian conflicts of the plain.
