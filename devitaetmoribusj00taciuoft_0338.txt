254 NOTEs. CHAPTER 35. [I‘AGE 50

quently they were again hostile to Rome and they joined the revolt
under Civilis. Pliny, N. H. XVI. 1, 1, 2, probably from personal
observation, describes them as wholly uncivilized barbarians, adding.
et hae qerzsces si vincantm· hodie (ι populo Romano servire se dicunt J,
in glaring contrast with the high eulogy bestowed upon them herc.

On the significance of this discrepancy, see Introd. p. lxiii. quam-
quam : on the subjunctive, see note ch. 28, 24.

4. omniurn . . . gentium: viz, in ch. 29 ff. The statement is
exaggerated for rhetorical reasons, lateribus: bozmci'arz'es, i.e.

west and south. So again in this treatise, ch. 36, 16, frons pointing
to the ocean and the north, tei-(sum to the interior.

5. obtenditur: faces, screa-hes αῖοης] opposite. So Ayr. 10, 73
Mela ΙΙ. 28 ; Plin. N. H. V. 19, 17, 77. in Chattos usque sinue-
tur: if Tacitus was not misinfornied or led into error by inaccurate
lnaps, we niust suppose that the Chauci and Chatti had respectively
inoved south and north and occupied part of the regions of the
Cherusci and Fosi after their downfall, the Angrivarii shifting into
the territory of the Bructeri. See ch. 33, 6 f.

¹7. sed et implent: cp. Vell. Pat. ΙΙ. 106, 2, omnis eorum (sc.
Chaucorum) iuvantem infinita ηἰιηιμνο.

8. quique :- talz's ut, consecutive subjunctive. iustitia tueri:
sc. quam ri. In the iclealized aspect in which the ancients viewed the
barbarians of the remote north (cp. Introd. p. lxiii), a love of jus-
tice always figures as their niost prominent characteristic. Cp. eg.
Iliad, XIII. (γ’), Ἀβίων τε, δικαιοτάτων ἀνθρώπων; Aesch. Prom. Salat.
sraslm. 196 N., δῆμον ἐνδικώτατον <βροτῶν> ἁπάντων . . . Γαβίους, the
Scythians being especially so eulogized. Sine cupiditate, sine
impotentia: without yreed, without ungmvernable «violence. An
abstract noun with sine is the idiomatic substitute in Latin for a
negative adjective not in use, and it is hence often in Tacitus combined
with other attributives. So eg. Dirzl. 32, 2, cz'rcwnvz'sa et amputata.
sinc adparatu, sine hmmrsq· 40, 10, sine obsequio, sine severitate,
vontmnaoe, temerarm; Anu. XIII. 35, sine miseracione. sine ira,
obstinatum clausumque. —In Αηη. XI. 18, it may be noted, Tacitus
speaks of the ferocia of the Chauci.

9. quieti secretique: tranquil and secludet-2. This statement is
slightly inconsistent with the vast extent of their territory, for that
'lucitus had in mind only those dxvelling near the sea is nowhere indi-
cated in the context. Cp. Vell. Pat. I.‹·. sicu lor-nrum tutissima.
