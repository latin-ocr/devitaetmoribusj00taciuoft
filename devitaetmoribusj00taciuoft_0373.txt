Cizn‘ioAL APPENDIX. 289

13, 6. ceteri] cercis. see PH. pp. 31-3:3; ceteris—MSS.

14, 28. tueare] tuentur—AB. On the change 01 subject see
note ad loc. Two distinct statements are made, one concerning the
comites and another about the princeps, a potentia] subjunctive with
the lndefinite second person is, therefore, out 01 place.

15, 5 non multum] (non) multum—Lipsius. Cp. PH. p. 41 1.

16, 30. hiemis] hiemi—MSS. See note ad 100.

18, 21. pluribus] plurimis— MSS. See note ad loc.

18, 22. To begin the chapter with Dotem, as Halm and others do,
rudely destroys the skilt'ul transition. See note ad loc.

18, 23. 1 should prefer to read (cuc 101· et. Cp. ch. 13, 1, precer vel
propinqum and above, ch. 5, 18.

19, G. saepta] saeptae — early printed editions. Apart from the
rhetorical J‘ustification 01 this reading as given in note ad loc.. it is
confirmed by numerous passageS, in 110110 01 which the participle
agrees with the ablative 01 1110 abstract noun. E. g. Cic. Parati. IV.
1, 27, mimus . . . virtutibus . . . saeptus ,· Brut. 96, 330 saeptmn
(sc. eloquentiam) liberali custodie& Liv. III. 44, 4, omnia pudore
saepta.

19, 20. maritum . . . matrimonium] matrimoniwn . . .
maritima. On this transposition, see PH. p. 34 f. and note ad loc.

22, 29. occupat] occupet—Prannneix The error arose out 01
occupem, 101 uc qm· in Tacitus and elsewhere invariably takes the sub-
J'unctive. Halm strangcly defends the indicative by referring to ch. 17,
9, where the verb is walsted.

22, 8. ioci] Ζοεί-ΑῗΒΖΗ, See PH. pp. 42-44.

23, 17 f. Si . . . vincentur] <Si . . . vincentur). That this
short paragraph cannot have been written by Tacitus has been shown
at length in PH. pp. 34-38. In this place, therefore, a brief enumera-
tion 01 1110 reasons which prompted the deletion may suffice.

(1) Inditlserz's and ebrietati, 10 fit into the context at all, must be
invested with meanings which these words do not appear 10 have
elsewhere, namely, to encouraye, and Iove osdri'nk. (2) viciis. The
faults which Tacitus imputes to the Germans are their Zazz'ncss, their
inebriety, and their passz'mz sor qamblings. But as these were ex-
hibited only in times 01 peace, there was no reason why the Germans
should have been unfit 101· a vigorous (10101100 against the Roman
invaders, as they themselves had been taught 011011 enough. (3) haud
minus facile. This litotes (not less easily) is nowhere, either in
Tacitus or in other writers, equivalent to the simple comparative ,·
