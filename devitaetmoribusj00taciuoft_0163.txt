trustworthiness, a signification, though extremely conunon in post-
Augustan Latin, still foreign to earlier writers. oblongae scutulae:
the exact shape of the dish called scutula is unknown. 11 may have
been rectangular or 111016 like a trapezoid or trapezium. Oblongmc
seems to indicate an elongation of two of its sides, which in a rough
way might c‹‘›1·respond to the configuration of. Great Britain. bipemii:
the center of the double battle-ax, representing the narrowest part of
the island. As rel, in place of (int, seems to show, there cannot have
been any essential difference in form between the scutula and the
bominis. But such coinparisons 1111131 not⁷ in any case, be too closely
pressed, based as they were upon very vague and untrustworthy in-
formation.

apposition. So also eg. Ami. XII. 1, hm‘c Pallas, illi Callistus scen-

tores aflera'nt. Et: and (cs α macter offocet. This asseverative use
