ΤΟ Λα). Later he incurred the displeasure oi' Vespasian by his un-
comproniising opposition and was finally executed in 713 ΑΛ).

20. saevitum: se. esse. triumviris: sc. capitalibus, the official
executioners. The delegation of the duty of burning condemned books
to these functicmaries instead oi to the aediles was intended as an
additional degradatiffli. —The earliest recorded instance of this prac—
tice is the burning of the alleged books of Numa in 181 nc. During
the empire such penalties were not unconnncni. The biographies
mentioned by Tacitus were the last so dealt with, the inefficacy of the
proceeding having gradually become apparent. Ι

21. comitio ac foro: the commum was situated north of the
„romam and was the usual place for punishnients. The apparently
pleonastic furo is added to einpliasize the publicity of the transaction.
So Plin. N. II. XV. 18, 20, 77. It corresponds to ia conspectu populi
of Liv. XL. 29, 14, libri? in counitio . . . ῖη, (3. J). cremati sunt.

Page 2. 2. conscientiam: Domitian in his shortsightedness
imagined he could prevent nien from retaining a vivid knowledge oi
these events. Cp. 'l'a(·. Ana. IV. 33, praesentet potentia. credunt egr-
cz'assw' posse etiam sequentis aevi vacinni-sani.

3. expulsis sapientiae professoribus: this took place in 9311).
—sapienfte'affl i'or weilos-officiat». Tacitus whinisically avoids, as far as
possible, Greek expressicms. So likewise, eg. philosophi and poeta. —
professor is a post—Augustali word. —— Tacitus is fond of 01031113Ὶ a period
with an ablative absolute. Cp. Introd. p. xxvii, and 011 the chiasnins,
ibid. p. xxviii.

4. atque is epexegetic of the preceding clause, i.e. and by so ‹Zne'nss
he banz'shed every ’κω-6113] accomplz'slzmenc. This high praise of phi-
Iosophy does not represent T's personal convictions, for it sti-angely
contrasts with ch. 4, 15 ff. (where see note). It seems here to be due
to a desire to stigmatize an act of Domitian at any price, for Vespa-
sian, styled by Tacitus pacientissimzes veri, had previously issued a
similar decree.

5. Dedimus profecto: the asseverative particle is generally omitted
in Tacitus, when the verb is placed at the beginning. Cp. Introd.
p. xxvi.

6. vetus aetas: i.e. the Republican period. This use os vetus
is characteristic of Tacitus.

7. nos: sc. vidimus So ultimum after quid, and esset after servi<
cuce are supplied froin the preceding by an easy ellipsis.
