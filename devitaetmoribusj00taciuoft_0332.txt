In the reign 01 Tiberius, they occupied the territory once belonging
to the Sugambri, 011 the right. bank 01 the river. They had
fought Lollius (17 Bc), Drusus (12 A.D.), and joined the Batavian
uprising in 70 Aa). The Usipi seem to have been finally subdued in
the reign 01 Domitian, and they are found among the auxiliaries 01
Agricola 111 83 ΑΒ. Cp. Assr. eh. 28. Their casual mention here may
well be due to 'l'acitus's aversion to credit Domitian with their subju-
gation. What is said 01 the Tencteri was in all probability equally
true 01 the Usipi ; at least, Caes. IV. 12, 1 1. confirms their equestrian
skill. colunt z accolunt, ‹szell αἶοηῃ.

Tencteri excel in horsemanship.

01 their rhetorical coloring, are to be accepted as on the whole
trustworthy, Tacitus attributes the custom 01 prz'inoyem‘ture and tesca-

alone, for the former is significantly omitted 111 ch. 20, 511.. while the
absence 01 wills is especially noted as characteristic 01 the Germans
generally; but the prout feror, etc., could only have been determined
by the testator in case there were several adult sons. We are not told
what disposition was made 01 the equi in ease there were no children,
or only daughters, surviving. excipit implies that the son adJ'udged.
the bravest could claim the horses ccc once, without waiting 101 the
regular distribution 01 the rest 01 the estate. It is, however, intrinsi-
cally improbable that all the horses should have been given to this son ;
more likely only the favorite steed of the father passed to him.
