Chapter 42. 4. annus. etc.: Africa and Asia, the two most
important senatorial provinces, were every year distributed, as a rule
by lot, among the two senior ex-consuls. As the interval which was
usually allowed to elapse between the consulship and this proconsul-
ship seems to have fluctuated between five and thirteen years, it is
impossible to determine exactly the date here alluded to. Agricola
had been appointed consul in the fall 01 77 min, and Tacitus left
Rome, undoubtedly in some official capacity, about SSUQO (cp. ch.
45, 4). As it is intrinsically more prob-able that Domitian had thus
honored Tacitus, before the expediency 01 rejecting the father-in-law
had presented itself to him, than that he should have followed up
this insult by prcmoting the son-in-law, Agricola's candidature must
be dated a year or two afim· Tacitus's departure.

5. sortiretur: he was to dmm loss for. On the final subjunctive,
see note ch. 34, 5. Civica: C. I'eccnlenus Civica Ceriales, legatus
pro praetore 01 lower Moesia in 82 ΑΛ). His consulship, not else-
where recorded, was therefore probably subsequent to this date. 101·
