lx INTRonUoTION. 11.

The identification of Germanic deities with the gods of
Rome and Greece was familiar to Caesar.l This process
must, therefore, antedate the de Bello Gallico, but if so,
there is no one, save Posidonius, to whom its general intro-
duction² can plausibly be attributed, for he is the only
previous scholar, so far as known, who paid any attention
to the mythology of Germanic and Celtic races.

Summing up this entire discussion, 1116 following conclu-
sions may be set down as reasonably established : -—

1. The material collected in the Germania is taken en-
tirely at second hand, for the hypothesis that Tacitus himself
visited German territory has nothing in its favor and every-
thing against it.

2. There is every reason to believe that a very consider-
able mass of details, far more than has generally been
supposed, was fnrnished directly to the author by friends

 

1 B. G. VI. 17, 1 ff.; 21, 2, where he says that Mercury, Apollo,
Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva were the deities worshipped by the Gauls,
but only the Suu, Vulcan, and the Moon by the Germans. See note
ch. 9, 28.

2 The fact that Tacitus styles this method {aremii-emtis) Romana
(ch. 423, 27) does not necessitate the assumption of a Roman source,
for its origin is unqnestionably Greek, as is evident from the identifi-
cation of Donar and the Alce· with Hercules and the Dioscuri (notes
ch. 9, 27 ; 43, 25 ft), these gods or demigods having no fixed place
in the Roman Pantheon. Probably shortly after Posidonius, some
Roman antiquarian substituted Jupiter for Ilerculae‘s, and this genuine
{neapo-etacio Romana was universally accepted, as is clear from the
Fr. Jeuch' (Jovis (lies) by the side of Germ. ‘Daetmzerstaq (Donar's
day), Engl. Thau-saw. Satmday (Saturni (Ises) also points to a
Roman origin. The Latin authority may well have been Varro, in
his libri rerum divinarum, published 111 47 Rc. and dedicated to
Caesar. Posidonius was demonstrably one of the sources of this great
work, and Tacitus may also have been indebted to it, but in mention-
ing Hercules, to the exclusion of Jupiter, he clearly follows the incer-
precatio Graeca.
