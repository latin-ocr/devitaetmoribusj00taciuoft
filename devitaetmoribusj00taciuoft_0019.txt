such reason he seems to give himself,l still another may
have been the example of Sallust, his great model at this
stage of his career as a writer, who inserts a similar account
of Africa in the ζῙιιῃιινϊήα2 before proceeding to the πράξεις
proper. Finally, this sketeh subserves the purpose of
acquainting the reader with the kind of people with whom
a Roman general had to deal and the geographica] condi-
tions with which he had to contend.

again in perfect conformity with the rhetorical norm, being
divided into two parts,4 Agricola’s military exploits (ch.
18—40, 2) and his life as a private citizen (ch. 40, 3-42)‚⁵ but
