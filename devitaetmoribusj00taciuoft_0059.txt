next to nothing for his purpose, that 116 did not hesitate to

Pliny's Natural History. —Tacitus⁷ indebtedness to the
Natural History of the elder Pliny has been advocated with
no less confidence, and yet this assumption is also demon-
strably erroneous. Admitting, what is not improbable, that
Tacitus was acquainted with this encyclopaedia, it does not,
in the first place, seem plausible that he laboriously searched
all through so vohuninous a compilation for details to be
utilized in his Germania ,· for, with the exception of a short
chapter in bk. IV„ Pliny’s references to Germany are few,
incidental, and scattered over the thirty-seven books. Now,
if we examine the passages upon which the above convic-

only three, omitting the first and last, but mentions another
classification on the authority of older sources,2 which added
the Vanam and three other tribes, one of which, the Suebi.
is given as a snbdz’vision by Pliny, while the other two are
omitted altogether. Again, the Suebi are clearly differen—
tiated by Tacitus from the Herminones, in flat contradiction
to Pliny. Finally, os: the tribes enumerated by the latter,
