ἐνδείᾳ . . . ἔζησεν. Quippe: frequent in Tacitus in the sense of
enz'm or nam, with the usual ellipsis. But this lack of worldly goods
Agricola bore with resignation, for, etc. He thus formed a marked
contrast to Asinius Marcellus, of whom Tac. Anii. XIV. 40, says:
clarus neque morum spernendus habebatur, nisi quod paupertatem
praecipuum malorum credebat.

29. vera bona, etc, : the well-known Stoic doctrine that the wise
and virtuous man is rich and a king.

30. impleverat: lae enj0yecl co the sullest extent, were liis in
abundans-e. In Tacitus again, He'st. Ι. 16, impletum est omne consil-
ium, si ce benc eleos, but quite frequent elsewhere. -It is a kind of
constructio praeyizaizs, as Hisc. III. 40, proditam a Lucz‘lz'o Basso
Ravennatem classem (z handed over through the treason of). Cp.
[nti-oa. p. xxxiii. et consulari: On the consulship as the goal of a
Roman's ainbition, see note De'al. 13, 29.

Page 30. 1. triumphalibus, eto: in this passage the honor of
the triuniphal ornaments is treated with less (lepreciation than in ch.
40, 21. All such distinctions were, however, regarded hythe Stoics
as ἀδιάφορα. Cp. Tac. Hisl. IV. 5, Περὶ ὕψους, 44. adstruere:
hos-torta ia addition. In this figurative sense first in Ovid, A. A. II.
111), thereafter connnon, eg. Plin. Epist. III. 2, 5- Ι11 Tacitus again,
Hisc. I. 78. —With the thought, cp. Isoc. Euass. 28, τί ’γὰρ ἀπέλιπεν
εὐδαιμονίας, etc. and Incrod. p. xxxvi.

2. filia . . . superstitibus: on the ablative absolute at the close,
see Introcl. p. xxvii. potest . . . effugisse: on the collocatio ver-
borum, cp. note ch. 42, 24.

3. dignitate z ‹Zz'ssnz'mcc senatoria. So again Ami. ΙΙΙ. 17; with-
out the ellipsis, Ami. ΙΙΙ. :303 XVI. 17.

4. adfinitatibus et amicitiis z adfinibus et amicis, here used in
an asyndetic enumeration, because the preceding nouus are abstract.
Cp. note ch. 16, 21. —The concrete sense of the former occurs in Taci-
tus only here and Anu.. XI. 24; of the latter, Hist. Ι. 10; 1163. 873
Anu.. II. 27. 773 IV. 40; V. 2. The thought is a connnonplace, as is
clear from Menander, Rhoe. Gr. IX. 293 (III. 420).

6. augurio votisque: coi-respond cliiastically to ‹Im-are in . . .
