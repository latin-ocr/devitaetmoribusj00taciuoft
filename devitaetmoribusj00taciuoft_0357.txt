24. religionis: rice. Cp. note 011. 39, 12. Praesidet: se.
relz'yz'om‘ ‚· calces charye of the ceremony.

25. muliebri ornatu: probably the priest was clad 111 a long robe
and wore thicker hair like women 3 at least the ffzzdz'nffe, the name of
the Vandilian royal family, means men wichs woaaan's Ιιαὶν, and the
king, as in all primitive society, also exercised priestly functione. Cp.
note 011. 10, 10.

26. Castorem Pollucemque: the worship of the twin brothers,
or Dioscuri, is Indo-European, and the interpretatio Romana (or
rather Graeca) is here not merely based upon accidental similarities
in ritual, as in 011. 3. 17 ; 9, 29, for the cults were originally identical,
but this was, of course, unknown to the Roman antiquar-iaus. Ea
vis numini: eorum (sc. Castoris Pollia-isque) vis 1111ίο quoquc nic-
minz'; i.e. their characterismos belong to this Germanic divinity.

27. Alcis : probably dative, by way of symmetry with 1111111ῖηὶ ,· cp.
note ch. 16, 30, and Critical Appendix, 011. tw, 20. With vocabalum,
however, we have the dative. in 011. 34, 24). The name 0001115 only here,
and its etymology is indeterminable. Nulla simulacra: this is in
keeping with the statement 111 011. 9, 2 ff. peregrinae supersti-
tionis : i.e. non-Germanic worship, the designation supersticio imply-
ing that this cult, unlike that of Isis, was not regarded as having been
imported. Cp. note ch. 9, ⁴29 f. The entire passage shows that
Tacitus or his authorities, while inclined to recognize the identity of
the German and Roman deities, were sorely puzzled at not finding the
concrete evidence in support of 11, by which they elsewhere established
their 11iytli‹2)logical parallelisms.

2. lenocinantur: ‹1ch to, enlmnce. In this weakened, figurative
sense the verb is post-Augustali. In Tacitus again, Dz'al. 6, 27.
nigra scuta: on the color-ing of shields, see note ch. 6, 12. tincta
corpora: in view of Plin. N. H. VI. 19, ⁴22, ΤΟ, linquatur sole populi,
