upon those who lived through these dreadful times. multi . . .
promptissimus quisque . . . pauci: notice the asyndeton. for-
tuitis casibus: owing] to natm-al causes. Cp. Αηη. XII. 52, morte
fortuita cn per ‘venenwn euinctus. Tacitus means to say that during
the reign of terror 111051 01 1115 illustrious 111511 capable of telling its
story had died a natural or violent death, while the few that survived
were too crushed in spirit and unlikc their real selves to undertake
the task.

24. promptissimus quisque: the plural verb after quisque, with
or without the superlative, is found 111 all periods of the language, but
is comparatively rare 111 Classical prose, except in Livy.

25. ut ita dixerim: like its equivalent 'ut sic ‹Zi'xerz'm (cg. Discl.
34, 29)), 15 a post-Augustan phrase for icc ica dicam. --The so—called
logical perfect subjunctive in subordinate clauses is very rare. —The
expression is here used to apologize for the 550111111ξ,Γ paradox in nostri
superstites.

26. exemptis e media vita tot annis: elsewhere in Tacitus
earz'mere invariably takes the dative—media vica 15 an elastic term.
Thus in ch. 44, 26, it is applied to Agricola, at the age 01 54. Accord-
ing: to a belief common among the Romans, 120 years constituted the
extreme natural 1111111 of human life. Tacitus himself was about 26
years old on the accession 01 Domitian (81 Ap), and therefore but
41 at Domitian's death. Senectus usually began at the age of 60.

27. ipsos exactae aetatis terminos: ιο the very limics osea-treme

danger to which an honest historiali or biographer ,would have exposed
himself. non tamen: in spite of the terrible ordeal through which
we passed.

29. pigebit . . . composuisse: the perfect infinitive refers to the
time when the implied action is completed. Cp. Verg. Aen. VII. 2:33,
nec . . . erceffl'sse pi'gsebz't. vel incondita ao rudi voce: these
1511115 are habitually used 01 an archaic and inartistic diction, but as
the Histories here alluded to—-they were not completed till 109—are
written 111 a style of consummate art, these epithets must not be taken
too seriously. Similar apologetic or mock-modest expressions occur
elsewhere, eg. Cic. Orat. (39, 2:30 (0011051-11111μΥ Antipater-*s introduction
to his Punic War); siat. Sila Ι. praef.; Apul. Met. Introd.; Fronto,
p. 242 ; Aelian, Ναί. Hisc. IV. 1 11. ; Liban. Ι. :liii 1.
