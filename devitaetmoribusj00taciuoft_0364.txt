15. diu, etc. e the ancient amber trade of the North Sea was in
the hands of the Phoenicians, and therefore of hoary antiquity. Under
the name of ἤλεκτρον, amber is mentioned repeatedly in Homer, e.g.
Oclglss. IV. 73; XVIII. 2963 also in Herod. 111. 115, ἐξ ἐσχάτης Εὐρώπης

. τὸ ἤλεκτρον. Subsequently it was brought south overland, one
route leading to the Black Sea, the other through the territory of the
Venedi, the southern neighbors of the Aestii, to Pannonia. Cp. esp.
Plin. N. ΙΙ. l.c. 43, Veneti primum samam ei rei secere proximique
Pannom·ae. From what follows it would seem that amber as an
article of adornment was not generally introduced among the Romans
till the time of Nero, and it is upon this fact that Tacitus, ignoring as
he does the older North Sea trade, apparently bases his otherwise un-

warranted statement. quin etiam: on the anastrophe, cp. note
ch. 3, 29. eiectamenta: probably a Tacitean coinage, found only

here and in Apul. Apol. 35. The more vulgar maris puryamentmn, is
used e.g. by Pliny, Le. 35.

16. iacebat: lay neylected. In this sense especially frequent in
Cicero. In Tacitus again, Ana. XIII. 55. luxuria nostra: the
Roman love of luxury. dedit nomen: sc. sucino,· brouyhz into
faslzz'on‚ repnte. This meaning of nomen is generally common.
With the thought, cp. Plin. N. H. Le. 49, in omnibus denique aliis
viciis· auc ostentatio aut usus placet, in suoz'm's sola delictorum con-
scientia ,· and Ayr. 12, 11 f. Ipsis in nullo usu: amber bracelets,
amulets, utensils, weapons, etc.‚ have been found 111 graves 011 Aes-
tian territory belonging to the stone age. Tacitus was here mis-
informed.

17. rude legitur, informe perfertur: i.e. it is gathered 111 its
rough, natural state, and brought to Rome in its shapeless form to be
there manufactured. Rude and iizfierme are again combined in Dz'al.
18, 53 20, 12 ; Anu. XII. 35. pretiumque mirantes accipiunt:
so Adam of Bremen says of the Aestii in general ε aarum et amentum
pro minimo (Ineunt.

18. tamen: i.e. although the Aestii themselves can give no infor-
mation 011 the subject, the resinoid character of ainber is apparent.
intellegas: on this ‘can-could-' potential, see note ch. 30, 5.

19. terrena quaedam . . . volucria: crawlz'nsj andwz'ngycd crea-
tures. Terrena, of beings confined to the carth, occurs only here.

Among thc anim-als found in amber, Plin. l.c. 46, mentions ants, gnats,
