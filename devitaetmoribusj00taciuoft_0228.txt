received with germine sorrow, would be songht with such eager haste,
the implication being that Domitian knew the cause 01 Agricola's
illness, and desired to learn as quickly as possible whether the poison
had done its deadly work. Thus Tacitus virtually expresses his
private conviction that the charge, though it could not be directly
brought home to the emperor, was substantially true. See also ch.

species, ¹in the sense 01 6 6116111 pretext, as opposed to what is real and
sincere, is common in all periods of the language.

15. piissimae: this superlative was censured by Cic. Phil. XIII.

ing to an ancient grammarian (Pompeius), Cicero employed it himself

18. bono patre . . . malum principem: the antithesis is empha-

only one name was recorded in the Fasti consulares.
