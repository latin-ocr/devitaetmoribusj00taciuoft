Professor Edouard W'tjlfflin, in the Archiv fiir Lateinisclze Lexikographie
und Grammatck. February, 1896. Aut geringem Raume ist viel wis-
senswiirdiges zusammengedrangt, und zwar rnit praktischern Geschicke:
zwei langere Listen geben die lateinischen Vvorter von bestrittener Quan-
titat und Orthographiev wobei die Ansatze von Marx oft berichtigt sind.
. . . Die deutsche &Vissenschaft wird sich nur sreuen dass das amerikan-
ische Schulwesen ein so brauchbares Hilfsmittel geu-onnen hat.

Hohe des heutigen VVissens.

Professor Harry Thurston Peck‚ Columbia College, N. V. .· Itis no exag-
geration to say that so compact‚ helptul, and practical a collection of
indispensable information cannot be found elsewhere in any language
whatsoever. Even in Germany, the horne os classieal enchiridia, nothing
has yet appeared that is so satisfactory. Professor Bennett seems to
divine by instinct just what questions arise in the mind of the student,
and he here answers them in advanee in a delightfully lucid and simple
fashion. . . . Everywhere the best authorities are cited; and it is certain
that to many teachers, as well as students‚ the rnere perusal of this little
manual will open up many new vistas, and will put thern in touch with the
most scholarly doctrine os the day. ln fact the book is one that no pro-
gressive instructor can afford to be without, as it summarizes an irnmense
amount of information that is ot the utinost practical importance.
