hostium . . . ceciderez ancient historialis generally shrink from

giving an exact number of the fallen in battle, even When such was
ascertainable. They prefer a round number instead, usually more or
less exaggerated, or else they refrain 110111 mentioning any. Cp. Plin.
Epist. IX. 16, 1, cnm historz'eormn more scribas numerum 1111νί non
potuisse. That this was the practice of Tacitus is expressly attested

by a now lost passage 01 his lissam-ies, cited by Orosius, VII. 10, 4,
m‘sl' C. Tacitus . . . (Ze reticendo interfectorum numero et &cllustium

dixisset. In his extant works there are only finer other exceptions,
viz. Germ. 33, 11 (over 60,000 Germane slain); His-t. II. 17 (1100
1101110118), Anti. IV. 73 (1300 Romans); XIV. 37 <80,000 Britons,
400 Romans). —The (ch decem milla is, 01 course, a mere guess. Cp.

ἠβουλήθη τῶν τότε συγγραψάντων ἱστόρησεν. The Roman lOSS Of 360
is perhaps authentic, the information being probably due to Agricola
himself. —On the repetition 01 1110 verb, see note ch. 32, 10.

13. 111 quis: this archaic 101111 occurs only here in the minor
Works, though very common in 1110 later writiugs—'l'acitus had
spoken (ch. 35, 15) 01 1110 glory 01 winning a victory without loss 01
Roman blood. The fate 01 this prefect is incidentally noted as
the only apparent exception, 101 even liis death was due to a mere.
accident. A modern writer would probably have mentioned this in a
footnote.

16. palantes, separatiny, equivalent to rari, above, 01 disiectos

ing their ranks.
