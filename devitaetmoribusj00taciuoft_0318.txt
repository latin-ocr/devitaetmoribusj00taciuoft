manic literature of the Middle Ages, in significant conti-ast with its
extravagant praises 01 spring.

Chapter 27. The account of Germanic funeral customs appropri-
ately closes the ethnological portions 01 1115 treatise.

25. ambitio: display. Funerals in Rome were, on the contrary,
conducted on so lavish a scale that laws were repeatedly enacted against
the abuse. For the meaning of the word, cp. eg. Ayr. 29, 233 Hist.
IV. 40; An 11. IV. 62 ; and Sen. (Ie brev. vit. 20, 4.

26. certis lignis z such as the pine, beech, and oak. These customs
are abundantly illustrated by the Beowulf. Cp. eg. vs. 3110, Bada he
then order . . . that they the ‚sire-woml should brings from asar.
crementur: burial seems to antedate the burning of bodies. In the
bronze age, the latter seems to have been the rule ; thereafter we find
both modes (11 disposing of the dead existing side by side. Unless we
suppose that Tacitus is here speaking only 01 clari viri, he would
imply that cremation alone was practised by the Germans, and this
seems, indeed, confirmed by passages of the Beowulf and the numerous
charred remains that have been discovered, although unburned 511515-
tons have also occasionally turned up in old graves. Cremation was
finally absolutely prohibited under Charles the Great.

27. Struem rogi, etc.: pyre structure,- roy& is a noteworthy
example of 1115 epexegetical genitive. nec vestibus nec odori-
bus cumulant: as was frequently done in Rome. Cp. the account
of the burial 01 Germanicus 111 Ann. III. 2, vestem odores aliaque
‚semei-um sollemnia cremabant. sua cuique arma: this is con-
firmed eg. by Beowulf 3137, For Ιιίηι then prepared che follt· . . . A
funeral pyro . . . Huny 'with lzelmets, rwith shielcls of war, and it is
attested as late as the eleventh century by Adam of Bremen, IV. 31,
tantulam cum eo armaque ,· but that this custom was not exclusively
Germanic 15 shown by Verg. Aen. VI. 233, imponit 51111 arma viro.
On the ellipsis of sed, cp. Introd. p. lxvii.

28. quorundam sc. nobiliormn. equus adicitur: so eg. in
the case of Baldr (111 1115 Edda) and 01 Essill. The Gothic king
Αἶαν-ἴε was buried full armed, together with his steed, and a horse's
head was found at Tournay, in 1653, 111 the grave of Kiug Childerich.
Sepulcrum caespes erigit: a bold figure, also used by Sen. Epist.
8, 5, hanc <zamam . . . caespes erexerit. Cp. also ch. 46, 8; Ηίει.
V. 6, praeffl'pwmn montium Libanum erz'ye'c (sc. Iudaea) ; Agsr. 12, 2.

29. monumentorum arduum et operosum: hypallage form.
