satisfactory accuracy. Now, a cai-eful comparisou between
the two 0111111013, where they deal with the sanie or similar
topics, reveals the fact that there is but a single passage 111
the Germania which can be said to betray the direct influ-
ence of Caesar-,¹ for the few other vei-bal coincidences ² per-
tain to statements which would naturally be expressed in
but one way. Other items of inforlnation exhibit either
noteworthy (ἵίυεη-ςγθῑιυθε or amplifications of so significant a
character as to preclude Caesar as the direct or even the ulti-
mate source of Tacitus on the. subjects in question. In fact,
the wealtli of new details aud the very nature of the mate-
rial 111 the Germania bear eloquent testimony to the advance
made 111 1110 geographieal and etlinological knowledge of
Germany since Caesar-'s time. Caesar, it cannot but be
admitted, had at best only a superficial acquaintance with
Germanic tribes, au acquaintance. inoreoxjer, acquired under
one-sided conditions. sor their most characteristic 0113101113,
” ceremonies, and modes of life could 011lev be obser-ved in
times of peace. A considerable part of the information
which he furnished 011 111030 subjects was, therefore, nec-
essarily secured at second hand. Nay, it cau even still
be shown that Caesar had himself occasionally consulted
earlier litei-ary sonrces³ which were, of course, equally
accessible to Tacitus. Ι

Caesar to the Gauls exclusively.
