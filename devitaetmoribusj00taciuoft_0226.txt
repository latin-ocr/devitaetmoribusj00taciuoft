or violent death, but J'ama in its present sense of an unenviable dis-
tinction or notoriety is generally common.

23. Sciant, eto: this famous passage, admirable alike in expres-
sion and in the sonorousness of its stately rhythm, not only sounds
the very keynote of Agricola's political convictions and lifelong prac-

tice, but it also embodiGs the principles by which Tacitus himself was ·

which lie inculcates the sanie opportunistie and temporizing doctrines.

rhythmica] clausulae, giVing a sonorous finish to weiglity sentiments.

25. industria ac vigor adsint : on the plural predicate with two
abstract nouns joined by ac, see note ch. 4, 21.

do so over perilous paths, their effort culminating, without any ulti-
mate benefit to their country, in a sensatIonal death. Tacitus does
not believe in politica] martyrdom, if it is not likely to bring about
the realiZation of the objects fought for. Cp. Anu. IV. 2ος XIV. 12,
sibi cansam sun-iculi jecit (se. Thrasea), ceteris libertatis Initium uon
praebuit.
