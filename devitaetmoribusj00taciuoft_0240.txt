156 CRITICAL APPENDIX.

grounds. For not only is the insertion of crebrae eruptiones between
intrepida hlems and et sibi quisque praesidio paleographically unwar-
ranted, but it also involves a flagrant violation of the Tacitean usage
of ec after an asyndeton, and at the same time rudely separates two
statements which clearly belong together.

22, 21. et erat ut] et ut erat—Hem·iclisen. This emendation,
independently suggested also by Purser, l.c. p. 192, is extremely easy
and satisfactory, while ut erac of the Mss. or et ercet ut is awkward
and ambiguous, referring equally to what precedes and to what sol-
lows. But Tacitus would certainly not affirm the charge involved in
acerbior. With Henrichsen's reading, he qualifies the statement in
two ways. Agricola was not acerbus, but at best only im'uczmdus,
and even that only adversus nudos, for he was habitually comis bonis.

23, 25. percucurrerat] percurrerat—Bm), Woelfflin. Tacitus
seems to have avoided the reduplicated forms in conipounds.

24, 32. nave prima transgressus: crossing over with a fieet for
the first time. The conjectures made to this passage are without
exception unwarranted. See G. R. 328 and notes ad loc.

24, 10. differunt: interiora parum, melius aditus . . . cog-
niti] ‹Iefferzcnc <in melius). Aditus . . . coynz'ti—Wex. Halm's
interpolation of 'interiora parum, apart from its boldness, attributes
to Tacitus a most gratuitous statement. In mellus is probably the
marginal note or interlinear gloss of some patriotic Irish scribe which
subsequently intruded into the text. The MS. tradition of the Ayrz‘c-
οἶα being distinct froin the other works of TacituS, and the contents
of this particular chapter appealing, as it must have done, directly to
Irislnnen, lends color to the supposition that the archetypon came
from one of the famous Irish scriptoria. Scribes have often relieved
their feelings by marginal remarks of this nature.

25, 21. timebantur] timebat—Ritter, timebant—MSS. Agricola
is the subject throughout (incohabat, amplexus, exploravit). There
is, therefore, no reason for writing timelncntur, particularly as timebat
is an equally simple correction. Agricola feared that the march of
a Roman army might be rendered dangerous by the presence of the
natives through whose territory they had to pass.

26, 17. et Romanis : Ι should prefer to read at with Baehrens.

28, ί). uno renavigante] uno rem-0 remiqsmte. Cp. O. R. 329.
The MSS. read uno reinz'yante, which is admittedly corrupt.

29, 24. Probably 'l‘acitus wrote tulit, sed (set) for tulit et, a case
of haplography, the final ⁴ t' (of. tulit) being, as often, mistaken for
