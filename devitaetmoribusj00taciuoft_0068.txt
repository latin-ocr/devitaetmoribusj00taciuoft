ΤΗΕ TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE GERMANIA.

The trustworthiuess of the varied and extensive informa-
tion imparted in the Germania is directly conditioned by
the nature of the sources consulted. That these compi-ised
the very best available 111 the author-'s time can admit of 110
question, but the following considerations may serve ‘co con-
firm the highly authentic character of this 'creatise

In the firs‘n place, we meet with scarcely a single stute-
ment offui-t which can he said to be instet-‹mtlgs improbable
or incre<lible¹ The significance of this observation will
he a11›preciated at its proper value, if we compare the
accounts 111 Strabo, Diodorus, Mela, Pliny, aud even Caesam
for these abound 111 numerous details which every modern
reader will ab once recognize as fabulous, grotesque, or 1111-
possible.

In the second place, it may he asserted, without qualifi-
cation. that Tacitus has not been convicted of a solitam
misstatement, where lie nze'ssltt or mast have known better. Not
that this treatise is faulbless3 011 the contrary, it contains
many items of information which modern stliolarship must
reject or, at least, modify3 but 111 every instance the error
is (lue to well-recognizable causes. The passage is either
obscure and misleading, owing to a desire for extreme con-
ciseness of expression, or else Tacitus [leals with topics on

 

 

able number of passages on Germanic geography and etlmology‚ it was
strangely, but without exception persistently‚ ignored by Roman writers

1There are a few details Which might make this impression, but
while Tacitus did not care to omit them altogether, he himself ex-
presses liis doubts as to their authenticity. Cp. ch. 2, 8: 3, 1 ff.;
5, 2ος 34, 25; 40, 14; 46, 24 ff.
