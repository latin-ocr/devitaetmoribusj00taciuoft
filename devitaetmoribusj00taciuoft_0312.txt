de re rust. I. 9, but apparently not elsewhere.

pervicacia: scnbl‘tornnes& obstinacy.

30. fidem: honor. This Tacitus regarded as an abuse of the
terni in a vres prava. condicionis: class, lcimz. per conmercia
tradunt: 1]ng (Iis-pose of throusllc the medium of trade, i.e. by ex-
changing these slaves for desirable coinmodities. The Germanic slave
trade mentioned by Caes B. G. IV. 2. 1 pertains only to prisoners
of war.

31. se quoque. etc: this is a fanciful explanation of Tacitus,
prompted. as usual. by the desire to give a rhetorical or epigram—
matic close to a chapter. In consequence, 110 has involved himself in
incongruit-ies ; for, as fidem shows. the loser's voluntary servitude would
not have been considered a disgrace, while the winner's action cannot
well have been due 10 a feeling of shame, but he probably had reason
10 sear trouble on the part of the unfortunate gainbler's relatives, in
case he retained the man as a slave in his own household. Again,
although pudor, as indicated by quoque, is predicated of both loser
and winner, its attributive genitive (victoriae) is applicable only to the
latter. pudore . . . exsolvant: the identical expression occurs
in Tacitus again, Hz'sc. III. 61 ; Ami. VI. 44.

Chapter 25. The discussion of a peculiar instance of voluntary
servitude naturally leads the author to describe the life of the slave
proper. Tacitus' knowledge on the subjects dealt with in this and the
following chapter was vague and confused and. as he had Roman con-
ditions constantly before his eyes. his statements do not accurately
represent the real condition of affairs. But to attempt to reconcile the
author with our equally vague information. as has so often been done,
is an idle and useless task.

32. Ceterum: spark-1729 ymen-any. slaves, etc.; here a resumptive
particle. Cp. note ch. 2. 11. servis: as a slave could not hold
property, and, as he is here compared with a Roman colonus, Tacitus
or his sources seem to have confused the serf proper (for it is 10 him
that the words verberare . . . impune esc apply) with the so-called
Lm, H &ri-(se, villae* ns, known to us from later times. The serf seems
not to have. belonged to the same tribe as liis master, except in such
instances as were mentioned in 011. 24, if. indeed. he was not generally
