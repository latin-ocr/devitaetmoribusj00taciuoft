19. delectos: elsewhere in the minor writings Tacitus has dissere.
On this change of usage, cp. note Dial. 10, 31. ante aciem ι as the
place of honor. Cp. eh, 31, 22.

20. Definitur et numerus: 30. peditum delectorum, just mentioned,
for that the equitatus was an elite corps 13 taken for granted. 'l'he
present passage, therefore, merely distinguishes between a select
infantry and the rank and file of pedites, called (teies below. Observe
the emphatic position of the predicate: and wlzat's more, even their
31 umber is fistal. centeni ex singulis pagis: the decimal system
in military and politieal organizations 13 primitive Indo-1¹]uropean, and
particularly conspicuous among the 1111111003, l'ersians, and Romans.
A passus according to Cae& B. (τ’. IV. 1, 4, formed the one-hundredth
part of. a {sens or ceritas, c‹i›ntributing annually a thousand soldiers,
which would thus correspond to the Roman eribus. A hundred delecti
pedites (the equiws are here not discussed for the reason given
above) would, therefore, constitute a sufficiently small contingent to
make it a distinction and an honor to belong to it. That the exact
one hundred was occasionally exceeded seems to be implied 111 ‹11ch
primo *niumm-us sum the original designation being traditionally
retained, as in the analogous case of the Roman centumviri and of
the German contuor, which in different localities and at different times
was equivalent to 110 pounds. Op. also note ch. 12, 27.

21. idque ipsum: viz. hnmlari, lrzcndarvd, heonlercscieqr'c.
quod: for qui. On the neglect of the attraction, cp. ch. 18, 1 ; and
note to Aqr. 21, 3.

22. nomen: title. On the singular predicate. see Introd. p. lxix.
Acies: here the common soldiery, as opposed to the equites and
clelectipedz'ces. *per cuneos : a wedgelike, eoinpact fiuanation, like
a Greek Δ. From its shape. the Romans compared it to a boar‘s head
(caput porci). This method of forliiation was still in use as late as
the battle of Hastings (1060 A.D.).

23. Cedere 1000: this wasv in marked contrast to Roman disei-
pline and 13 sneeringly alluded to by (lerinanhfus 111 his speech on the
eve of the battle of Idisiaviso. Cp. Anu. 11. 14, sine cura dueum ‹ibn-e.
