PAGE 41] NOTES. CHAPTER 16. 207

the word having the same variety of meanings, as the Greek ὕλη, i.e.
wood, matter of which something is made. subject matter, and matter
as a philosophical term opposed to mind. informi : which is simpe-
less, the adjective being used predicatively. citra: a favorite
post-Augustali substitute for sine, on which see note Assr. 1, 12, the
prepositional phrase taking the place of a missing negative adjective.
Cp. ch. 35, 9, and note Dz'al. 32, 2.

26. loca: ie. the exterior.

27. terra: presumably akind of ochre or lime used as a sort of
whitewash. aut: or rather ‚· for this qualifying or restrictive sense,
cp. note ch. G, 11.

28. lineamenta colorum: volco-ed ontle'nes. imitetur: re-
sembles, {sii-estha appearance os. So not infrequently, eg. l'lin. N. H.
XII. 6,12, 24, folium alas avium imitatur ,· Juv3 VII. 412. subter-
raneos specus : also ascribed to other peoples, as the Scythians, Thra-
cians, Cappadocians. and Armenians.

29. insuper: nn top. Cp. note ch. 12, 20. fimo: in certain
parts of Germany they are still called dunk (Engl. duay). suffu-
gium hiemi: a bold use of the attributive dative, in place of an
objective genitive (so ch. 46, 18). hiems being a quasi-personification.
The construction occurs in the smaller writings only here and ch. 23,
12, but is exceedingly frequent in the Annals, eg. I. 3, subsidia domi-
nationi. It seems to be here due to the desire to librate With recep-
taculzmz frugsz'bus. On this favorite device of Tacitus cp. eg. notes
ch. 30, 293 40, 43 43. 27 3 46, 21 ; Ayr. 15, 26.

30. frugibus: ωορδ. With the statement, cp. especially Pomp.
Mela ΙΙ. 1, 10, ob saeva hiemis admodum adsiduae, demersis ιή
humum sedibus, specus aar defossa habitant (sc. Sarthae); Verg.
θεον-9. ΙΙΙ. 376.

Paga 41, 1. molliunt: aller-iate.

2. advenit: perfect. abdita . . . defossa: so combined in
Hz'sc. III. 33.
3. aut . . . sunt: a somewhat strained antithesis occasioned by

the author's desire to end the chapter with an epigrammatic point.
Cp. Introd. p. lxiv. The enemy either does not know of the existence
of these caves, or, if he does, he fails to find them, because he has not
the requisite time to search for them. Cp. Curt. VII. 4, 17, 24,
scrobes quos ita sollerter absrondmzt (sc. Bactri) etc ‘nisi qui defode-
runt invenire non possint.
