ΤΟ what extent, finally, books, if any, were consulted for
the account of the etlesnoloygs and ([999111Μῃ] of Britain, it is
impossible to determine. Tacitus himself 1195 9911911111

these topics, for he singles out Livy and Fabius Rusticus

whom Tacitus styles semmua-5 auctorum in the Germania
(ch. 28, 5), seems not to have been consulted, or 1911191 119
was intentionally ignored, for he cannot be included among

had cavalry 95 well as chariot fighters, whereas Tacitus mentions 01111
the latter, whom he calls covimzrcrz'z', for which Caesar says essedarii.
But the contradiction is, perhaps, only apparent, for Tacitus is speak-

true of the latter was not necessarily applicable to the former.
