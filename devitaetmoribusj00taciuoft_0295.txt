Latinum Aeneadae possint. plurimis = compluribus, multis, a
weakened sense, especially frequent in later Latin, eg. Min. Fel.
Octav. 18, 5; cp. also ch. 31, 193 35, 14; 40, 253 43, 203 and the use
ofplerique. plerumque, on which see notes ch. 1, 9 3 ΑΨ. 1, 10.

22. Dotem . . . offert: this dowry represents the sur-vival of the

custom of wife-purchase Which prevailed universally in primitive -

society, but it is not improbable that even in Tacitus' time this gift
was not given to the bride diiectly, but to the father-in-law, who
thereupon relinquished his patria potestas. With the statement, cp.
Strabo III. 4, 18, παρὰ τοῖς Καντάβροις τοὺς ἄνδρας διδόναι ’γυναιξὶ προῖκα ;
and Hor. (ἴω-111. ΙΙΙ. 24, 19 f.‚ of the Scythians, 1166 dotata reyic virum
Coniux. Among the Romans, 011 1116 011161 hand, the lack of a dowry
was considered so disgraceful that the relatives of the bride felt it
incumbent upon them to provide for one. Cp. esp. the Trinummus
of Plautus in which the whole plot hinges upon this point.

24. munera z dotem. There is nothing in the context to warrant
the inference that Tacitus was here alluding to 1116 so—called morning
gift which the bride received from her husband the day after the
wedding, as 111 hum* 111 unera usam accipitur is sufficient to show. The
repetition of munera, an instance of epanalepsis, is in keeping with
the elevated style of this paragraph. The figure is extremely frequent
in poetry, esp. in Lucretius, Catullus, Propertius and Vergil, but
naturally rare in prose. Cp. eg. Plin. Epist. V. 6, 10. inde campique,
campi ,· Panegl. 65, lembus subiecisti, quibus,· 82, hostium prospec-
taret, hostium. Exactly as here, I'ropert. Ι. 3, 25, munera 30111110,
Munera. delicias muliebris: Tacitus has particularly 111 mind
the costly paraphernalia of a Roman bride, such as jewelry, toilet
articles, genis, dresses, and the like. Cp. Juv. III. 160, puellae Sar-
cinulis impar (sc. the poor wooer). Ι

25. boves et . . . et: the polysyndeton draws attention to each
single 6161116111 111 1116 enumeration. Cp. Introd. p. lxvii.

26. frenatum equum : caput-isoncii steed, a poetic expression, e. g.
Verg. Aen. V. 554; Caes. BG. VIII. 15, 4. With the statement, cp.
Cassiod. Var. IV. 1, equos 111-11611160 colore vestitos quales decuit esse
nuptiales. In haec munera: 011 the strenqth (in view) os these
91113. With this use of in, quite frequent in Livy, cp. eg Tac. Anu.
XI. 13, in mortem parentum.

27. in vicem ipsa: this was only one part of the presents‚ the
sword, in particular, symbolizing the transference or abandonment of
the patria potestas. the woman passing into the control of the hus-
