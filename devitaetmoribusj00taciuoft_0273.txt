matio close of the chapter is a favorite device of Tacitus, but particu-
larly conspicuous in this treatise. Cp. Introd. p. lxiV.

Chapter 10. 6. Auspicia sortisque: the generic term is defined
by the more particular. Cp. Introd. p. lxviii. ut qui maxime ob-
servant z observant uc iz? [1ch inarime observant. A common elliptical
expression, eg. Liv. V. 25, 9. but in Tacitus only here. The fact
itself is abundantly confirmed. Cp. e.g. Caes Β. G. Ι. 50, 4; Amin.
Marc. XIV. 1⁴). 9.

7. simplex: uniformi, in contrast to the Romans. who had several
methods of casting lots. frugiferae arbori: probably the apple
tree and acorn-bearing trees. such as the oak, and ,especially the beech
(cp. Engl. bools. Germ. biit-h). Later, however, also the willow was
used.

8. decisam: this is confirmed by the etymology of. Engl. lot,
Germ. Ios, meaning something broken off. notis: this is the
earliest mention of runos. for nota is a technical terni for a letter
in Latin. They numbered originally 16 ideograms and constituted a
kind of hieratio alphabet. The Roman letters, which were donbtless
known to the Germane from an early time through coins. seem not to
have been in general nse before the 221 century Ab.

9. candidam vestem: white was the prerequisite color in all
religious ritual, as symbolical of purity. Cp. Plato, <Ie legs. XII. p.

similar synonymic collocations are very frequent. As here, eg. Cic.

public concern. Consulem is the vose propria for augury. For the
indicative, where the subjunctive of repeated action would be more
usual, see e.g. ch. 11, 14. sacerdos civitatis: probably the oldest
priest in the tribal community. Originally doubtless the princeps
exercised the priestly function as well. as eg. in Homeric society.
See also note ch. 43, 25.
