deliberately selected so brief ¹ and ludicrously inadequate
a paragraph as this for imitation is like maintaining that
a Kiepert or a Mommsen consulted a school geography
or history. There is, moreover, very little in this chapter
to correspond to the account of Tacitus, the similar items
of information being of the most commonplace character
and partly found in Caesar.

Under these circumstances, it is quite superfluous to
discuss at any length the alleged stylistic influence of Mela
upon Tacitus. Suffice it to say that the vei-bal coincidences
so zealously collected,‘-' either do not pei-tain to the same
topics or were unavoidable, many expressions belonging to
the common vocabulary of the langnage, while in others
the resemblance is imaginary or, at best, extremely faint.3
Finally, as these fancied reminiscences are culled from all
the three books of Mela, and not, as one would expect, from
the chapter on Germany alone, it would logically follow that

3 ΤΟ substantiate this charge, it will suffice merely to select at
random a few out of many phrases of Mela, more or less closely
paralleled in the (immania, all of which have been seriously adduced
to establish Tacitean indebtedness: sassum (cp. 17, 4); magma ex
parce sz’lvz's ac paludibus ’ίηυία (5, 14); insitam feritatem (43, 1);
