iV PREFACE ΤΟ THE GERMANIA.

tions, programmes, etc.. as l had been unable to secure, were
happily accessible to me in the Bodleian Library and the British
Musmun, during the sunimers of 1598 and 1899. For the sty-
listic treatment Ι have as heretofore mainly relied upon my own
collectanea.

The text of this edition, though it departs from that of Halm*
in more than fifty places, is conservative, for in eighteen instances
Ι return to the Mss„ while in the others my readings are either
not without some MS. authority, or else the correction is of the
simplest description possible and i111peratively demanded by the
context or by Tacitean usage, as will be evident even from
the necessarily brief discussion in the Critical Appendix.

Special pains have been bestowed upon the prosody of the proper
names, so far as this may be determined by their occurrence in
poetry and ‘the‘ Greek transliterations, conflicting though their
evidence often is. The linguistic criteria so constantly employed
I have found quite unreliable, partly because of the doubtful
etymology of the names themselves, partly because they have
passed through a process of Latinization with all the prosodical
changes which that involved.

The innovation of superimposing· the modern upon the ancient
map, designed to obviate the frequent necessity or expediency of
consulting two maps, will, I hope, commend itself to teachers and
students alike.

In conclusion, Ι acknowledge with profound gratitude the in-
valuable benefit which this book, in its passage through the press‚
has received at the hands of my friends, Professors Charles E.
Bennett and John C. Rolfe.
