it be. ,

To relieve the weary monotony of geograyfflical names
with which the rhetorician found himself confronted, re-
course is accordingly had to stylistic embellislnnent. As
regards ethnological details, which Mela distributes with a
lavish and reckless hand, it may be said that there is per-
haps no ancient treatise, professedly scientific and didactic,
which so teems with grotesque information, culled from the
rich storehouse of Hellenic fancy, myth, and anecdote, for
everything is grist that comes to his rhetorical mill. Pliny
the Elder, omnivorous reader that he was, does, indeed, cite
the Chorossraplnu of Mela as among his sources, but there-
after all germine traces of its influence disappear until
the early Middle Ages. The value which attaches to it in
modern times 15 solely due to the accident that it is 1116
earliest geographical treatise extant in Latin, and that it
contains no fewer than fifteen hundred geographica] names.¹

Now, the tlze'rd chapter of the third book, comprising less
than fifty lines, is devoted to Germany, and to this extremely
meagre account we are asked to believe that Tacitus was
under deep obligation for many details of fact, while his

¹ Mela seems to have been chiefly indebted to a geographical work
of Cornelius Nepos, who is expressly quoted, and to some map, perhaps
that of Agrippa. Eudoxus, Hipparchus, and Hanno, though also cited,
were doubtless known to the author only at second or third hand.

2 How deeply rooted this conviction 15, will be best illustrated by
the fact that all recent editors have had no scruples to change redit to
recedit (ch. 35, 2), simply because of a similar passage in Mela, and
yet the unanimous reading of the Mss. is not only wholly unobjection-
able, but it is supported by Vergil, and, finally, by none other than
Mela himself ἱ See note ad loc. and Crit. Appendix.
