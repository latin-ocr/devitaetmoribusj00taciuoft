the so-called gnomic perfect which is chiefly poetic. In prose, eg.
Sall. Cat. 11, 33 51, 113 Tac. Anu. III. 66. lVe may, however,
equally well regard eleqz't as an archaic form of the present (cp. incel-
leyo for ἱηίρῖῖίῃο), in which case the line would be a senarius.

28. consul: in Jan. 77 Aa), egregiae tum spei: this seems
to have been an expression for the inarriageable age of women. She
was then thirteen years old. Our extant inscriptions furnish eigh-
teen instances of marriages at this age, sixteen at twelve, and twenty-
one at fourteen years, twenty-one of the total belonging to Rome.
The usual interpretation of this passage must make tum z etiam teani,
a meaning which is not found anywhere. iuveni mihi: Tacitus
was about twenty-three or twenty-four years old at the time of liis
marriage, being* born about 54]·55 ΑΛ).

29. post consulatum: i.e. in 78 A.n.——Ag1‘icola's consulship
seems, like his other curule offiees, not to have been marked by any
features worth reeording, and, therefore, Tacitus contents himself
with this bare reference. See note ch. 6, 27. His colleague was the
future emperor Domitian, then twenty-six years old, and consul
suffectus for the fifth time.

1. scriptoribus: subjective dative. See note ch. 2. 17. —Among
the writers probably referred to, besides the two mentioned, were
Pytheas, Posidonius. and Sallust.

2. curae ingeniive: as Tacitus's predecessors are said to have
covered up their ignorance by rhetorical embellishment, curav cannot
designate, as it frequently does elsewhere„ laborz'ous res-earclz, but is
here synonymous with ars, which is frequently contrasted with insse-
m'um or natura. Cp. eg. Quint. X. 1, 107, curae plus ἰη ill0(De1nos-
thenes), in hoc (Cicero) naturae. Cic. ad Q. fr. II. 9 (11), 4; Ovid,
Trist. Π. 423 f.‚ Am. I. 15, 13. This also accounts for the use of
eloquentissimi (below, l. 11) in place of summi, locupletissimi, or the
like.

3. tum primum: a similar reason for treating a subject more in
detail is given in Ann. II. 27, eins neglecti initium . . . curatius disse-
