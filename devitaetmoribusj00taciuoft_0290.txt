206 NoTES. CHAPTER 16. [PAGE 40

Chapter 16. 18. populis : on this so-called subjective dative, see
note ch. 3. 30. urbis: i.e. fortified towns. The fact, to which
Tacitus here appeals as one 01 common knowledge, is amply attested
by references in other authors. In the 4th century, victorious Ger-
man tribes were still averse to occupying towns which they regarded
as wmcm'menm serrste'i (Tac. Hist. IV. 64). This repugnance, due
to their nomadic instincts, was not overcome till the llth century
under Henry, the founder 01 cities (der &asiacam-iiader). The late
occurrence 01 the German word Soada (city), is also confirmative 01 the
above statement. ·

19. ne pati quidem: ‹lo ‘not calce lcimlly co, <la not like. In this
weakened sense, pati is quite common, eg. ch. 42, 8; 43, 153 Dz‘ccl.
10, 21 ; 40, 26. inter se iunctas sedis: voncz'yuous ‹lwelllnsss.
The clause is joined asyndetically, the infinitive depending upon
votum est. Colunt: (Zenell.

20. discreti ac diversi: separatam and promz'scuously. The
Latin is fond 01 such alliterative groups 01 synonyms. Cp. Cic. pro
less. Μαη. 4, 9, locis disinnotissimis . . . ‹lz'versz's; Lucret. V. 1441,
‹Iivz'sa . . . ἀίειν-(1011116(141113, and below, 1. 21. ut. . . ut. . . ut:
note the effective anaphora. The statement ig, in a measure, con-
firmed by the endings 01 many modern city names, eg. Lauterbrun-
nen, Ansbavh (fons), Bielefeld, Lindenau (campus), Fuerstenwalde,
· lVernigerode (nemus).

21. Vicos: a group of homesteads. conexis. . . aedificiis
seems to be a merely redundant amplification of incer se iunctas sedes.
Cp. note ch. 15, 6. The supposition that Tacitus means to distinguish
the dependent farmsteads and the dwellings 01 the free, including
the manor of the lord, is not confirmed by the context, though such
differences unquestiomibly existed.

22. spatio: an open space or yard fenced 111.

23. sive . . . sive: these clauses are an explanatory apposition 01
spacia circumdat, although the Germans' ignorance of stone buildings
is in itself the reason, why precautions against fire were imperatively
called for.

24. Ne caementorum . . . tegularum: explains wherein this
inscitia (cedisicanslzss consisted, nam being, as often, omitted, eg. ΑΨ.
13, 15. This is confirmed by the observation that the German words
1⁰⁴ »r other than wooden material, such as cernent, chalk. mortar, brick,
tile, etc.. ar(¹ of Latin origin.

25. materia: timlwr. So eg. Caes. Β. (γ’. IV. 17, 8; Amo. I. 35,
