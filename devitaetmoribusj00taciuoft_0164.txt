80 NOTEs. CHAPTER 10. [PAGE 7

17. adfirmavit: confirmed ,· for that Britain is an island had been
asserted by Pytheas and others, but Agricola's fleet first demonstrated
it. It is to this achievement that the only ancient author, besides
Tacitus, who mentions Agricola, refers. Cp. Dio Cass. LXVI. 20.

18. Orcadas: i.e. the Orkneys. That they were wholly unknown
up to this time, as Tacitus states, is disproved by Mela and Pliny —
The Greek accusative plural occurs in Tacitus but rarely and only in
proper names. Cp. Germ. 45; He'st. IV. 553 Αηη. ΙΠ. 61; IV. 513
XII. 32, 33, 38; XIV. 29.

19. Dispecta: was clescrz'ecl in che distance ,· but, unlike the Ork-
neys, Thule was not subdued, because they had no orders to do so,
and even if they had, the approaching winter would have made it
inexpeclient to attempt its subjugation, the tacit assumption being that
the Romans would have had no difficulty in accompl-ishing the task. ——
The verb at the beginning, and at the same time in juxtaposition with
domuit, skillfully emphasizes the antithesis. Thule: first mentioned
by the distinguished navigator, Pytheas of Massilia (4111 cent. B.o.),
and regarded by the ancients generally as the most northerly point of
the earth, hence ultima Thule (Verg. Geom. Ι. 30). It was said by
Pytheas to be six days' sail from Britain, the night and day being six
months long. Hence it has been rashly identified by some with Ice-
land. The island here referred to was probably Mainland, the largest
of the Shetland group. It can be seen from the Orkneys. hac-
tenus: sc. proqrmh‘, to advance up to this point only, with special
reference to dispecta est. Their orders were to return, so soon as
Thule was sighted. The omission of cantion is a noteworthy Latin
idiom. et -- et praeterea. In this treatise again ch. 11, 5; 15, 303
26, 173 29, 243 30, 273 31, 203 38, 26. So also ac (1. 25).—The date
(83 Ar.) as well as the season of the year is fixed by ch. 38, 29.

20. mare pigrum: corresponds to the πεπηγυῖα θάλασσα of
Pytheas. the mare concretum of Pliny, and may represent the seas
of the northern ocean filled with floating masses of ice in Which an-
cient mariners may well have found it difficult to make any headway.
In the Germ. 45, 25 the ocean west of Scandinavia is similarly styled
mare piarum ccc prope inmotum. As we see from this description, the
knowledge of these regions had been but little advanced in the four
centuries that separate Tacitus from Pytheas. ——On the brachylogy in
this clause, cp. Imm-od. p. xxxiii. perinde: sc. ac cetera maria, an
elliptical comparison common with perinde, aequo, and the like. This
sluggish sea is not stirred like other sheets of water even in a storin.
