30. nam: like enim, with the usual ellipsis. The horse and the
spear the comites demanded as an inalienable right, but the epulae,
ete.

31. epulae . . . adparatus: meals . . . banquets. The collo-
catio verborum forbids us taking these words as a hendiadys
for epularum adparatus. To become a beoaqeneatas, ‘a table com-
panion‘ of the lord, was a high honor. For descriptions of such feasts‚
which were purely 1·οῑ untary 011 the part of the princeps, see Beowuffl
483 ff, 620 ff, 1025 ff. Their inexpensive and unrefined, albeit plenti-
ful, character is placed in sharp contrast with the extravagance and
over-elaboration of Roman banquets. Cp. Hz'st. Ι. 88, luxuriosos
adparatus conviviorum ,· ΙΙ. 62. exhausti convirz'ormn adparacz'bns

32. pro stipendio cedunt: pass as pay. for the princeps
could furnish these meals or not. at his discretion, the antithesis
between esciqunt (commas) and epulae cedant being strongly marked
by the position of the predicates, a kind of chiasnms. In this sense
cedere pro is extremely rare. Cp. ag. Cato, (Ie (cyriculc. 150, 2;
Colum. 12, 14. Materia: the means, also a rare use of the word.
Cp. Ovid, Met. VIII. STG. munificentiae: includes the gifts and
the banquets. Cp. Beowulf, 2431‚Ga1:e me treasure and feast, i.e.
accepted nie in his comitatus.

annus, yearly produce, see note ΑΨ. 31, 10.
