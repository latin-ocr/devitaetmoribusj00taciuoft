XiV' INTRODUCTION. 11.

orate speeches (ch. 30-32, 33-34> are said to be out of
place in a biography.

The Relevancy of ch. 28.-—As regards the first of these
objections, it may be admitted that a modern writer would
in all probability have relegated the item to a scot-note, if
he had thought it worthy of mention at all, but this device
was unknown to the ancients, who were compelled to insert
such passages in the body of the text. The episode is,
however, by no means as irrelevant as it might seem at
first sight, for it admirably shows of what heterogeneous
and unruly elements the army of Agricola was composed,
thus enhancing the merit of a general capable of fusing
them into an effective instrument of war, a fact subse-
quently emphasized by implication, in that the decisive
battle was won wholly by the Roman auxiliaries, of whom
the Usipi had constituted a part. Again, if the adventure
was thought by Tacitus too noteworthy and interesting to
be omitted, it could have found no other place without
destroying the chronological sequence of events, which
is rigidly adhered to throughout. Finally, the passage
subserves a (li-(matie purpose. The author had been mar-
shaling all his facts to lead up to the denouement. With
the closing words of ch. 27, 3, atque 'fta ‘inritatis utrimque
<mimis discessum, the no less excited reader feels the op-
pressive calm that precedes the storm, feels that the final
crisis is at hand, and just as often in the Greek drama a
soothing choral chant precedes the catastrophe, so Tacitus
has here introduced the maynum ac memorabile fizcz‘nus by
way of diversion, before he proceeds in the next chapter to
the detailed story of the final struggle, destined to prove so

after his retirement, and, therefore, Tacitus passed over the former
briefiy, while the latter are dealt with at some length. The same
inethod is favored by Menander, IX. 216 (ΙΙΙ. 369), τὰ μὴ ἀναγκαῖα
λυσιτελεῖ παρατρέχειν,
