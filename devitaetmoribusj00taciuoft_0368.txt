The following highly rhetorical passage furnishes the best extant
example of the fanciful idealization of unknown northern races so
characteristic of the ancients from Homer down. Cp. Introd. p. lxiii.
All the Germanic traits of the Feuni are accentuated, while. the ethni-
cal distinctions are all carefully enumerated and invested with a halo
of romance. Some oi' the colors of the picture seem to have been con-
tributed by Lucretius. See below.

13. non . . . non . . . non: on the anaphora here and again ll. 19.
22, see Iam-od. p. lxvii. penates: i.e. they have 110 family life or
fixed habitations. Cp. ch. 15, 8; 25, 1 f. victui herba: i.e. they

have no agriculture, but such vegetable food as they use grows wild.
This could, of course, be true only for the summer, but Tacitus habitu-
ally ignores the winter in his account of the remote north, doubtless
because the information available to him was originally gathered by
traders who would visit these regions only in summer. See 11. 18 f.
and note ch. 45, 26. The slight contradiction between this statement
and l. 15f. must not be too closely pressed in a description so largely
imaginative, particularly as it may have been in part caused by the
Lucretian reminiscence cited below.

14. cubile humus: cubile for cubili is intentionally used to mark
the close of the asyndeton, similar devices being characteristic of Taci-
tean style. The same phrase occurs, e.g. Curt. 111.2, 5, 15. With
the entire passage, cp. Lucret. V. 816, terra cibum pueris, vestem vapor,
herba cubile. solae . . . opes : their only resom'csss consisz in, as
contrasted with the primitive conditions just mentioned (non arma . . .
lemnus). quas . . . ossibus asperant: whose points thoyth) wz‘ch
bone. This is said to have been the practice of the Sarmatians (Pausan.
Ι. 21, 5) and the Iluns (Amin. Marc. XXXI. 2, 9), and it is still in
vogue in Lapland and in northern Siberia.

16. alit: the verb is here perhaps used in the figurative sense of
ρίυίφις] occupation to, for to say that both men and women partook of
the game is a gratuitous and seli-evident statement, not to mention
that partem . . . petunt would thus be an intolerable tautology.
The whole passage simply describes an active out—door life, taken up
for the most part with the chase. passim : in (cll directions, de-
rived from pando, to spread. In Tacitus this meaning occurs only here
and Hist. Ι. 81; Anu.. VI. 503 XI. 32. comitantur: sc. sentinae
viros. partem praedae petunt : alliterative. The entire statement
is confirmed by Procopius (6th century), whose description of the Fenni
in general is in remarkable agreement with the account of Tacitus.
