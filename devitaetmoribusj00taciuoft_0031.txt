STYLE AND RHETORIC. xxv

listic originality, may well have exerted 3 powerful attrac-
tion upon 3 mind such 33 Tacitus’s. But, at the same time.
he seems t«) have been captivated by the nobility of 1722·-
{sillan diction. In the Histories 31111 Anmdg he to 301116
extent emancipated himself from the style of Sallust, but
the influence of the great poet never waned, remaining con-
spicuously in evidence in 311 1113 1νο1·κ3.

Ι11 the Assy-{cola these two streame still blencl in happy
harmony, producing 3 style 33 far removed from the ‘milky
richness' of the Dialogyus 33 it is froin the succinctness of
expression in the Historz'es, or the still greater 6011613611633
of the Annals. But 3 111311 of such 11161311Υ gifts 33 Tacitus
is never 3 inere imitator, 31111 hence we find that certain
features characteristic of his mature 31111 (leveloped style
already appear in the Agyre'c‹)la, 1113 earliest treatise of 311
historical character. The most iiotew‹'›1·tliy of these are 3
straining for the utmost brevity, which occasionally resulted
in obscurity, 31111 3 deliberate avoidance of the 60111111011111366,
the trite, or formulaic, which led him to coin new expres-
310113, or to give a novel turn to 0111 01163.

Τ116 following survey 311113 to give in 3 conveniently tabu-
lated form 3 collection of the most interesting stylistic 31111
rhetorical features met with in this 151·63’ῡ136.1
