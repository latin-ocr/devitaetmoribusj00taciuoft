allay any suspicion as to the probability of one priest doing away with
a number of slaves. Probably there were more than one present. but
the death penalty was a precautionary measure to prevent the fraud
which they practised upon the people from being divulged by the
servi, the sacrifice of human victims being, doubtless, represented as
an essential part of the ritual, as in the Herminonic ceremonial of the
Semnones. Cp. ch. 39. The priests thus secured necessary help, and
at the same time were free from all suspicion of foul play.

16. hinc : hence arz‘ses. On the ellipsis, see note ch. 9, 29.
ignorantia : the desire to secure an effective close has involved
Tacitus in a slight inconsistency, for he had just said that the people
did not consider themselves in the dark, helieving illud, etc, to be
numen ipsum. quid sit illud : the indirect question depends upon
the verb implied in z'ynorantia.

Chapter 41. 18. Et . . . quidem . . . <sed> propior: this
ellipsis of sed after et . . . quidem is especially common in Tacitus.

19. quo modo . . . sio for ¹uz . . . ica (sic), is of frequent occur-
rence in Tacitus, but it was here particularly used to avoid the repeti-
tion of ut. paulo ante : viz. ch. :32 ff.

20. Rhenum: se. secutus surm, to be supplied ont of sequar. On
this ellipsis, cp. note ch. 36, 21. Hermfindi'irorum: for their
location, see map. Originally they dwelt somewhat further north.
the Elbe separating them froin the Semnones. After the Marcoma-
nic war (176 An), they disappear froin history, being assiniilated by
the Thuringians As the name seems to imply, they belong to the
Herminones (see ch. ⁶2).

21. non in ripa . . . sed: non<solum> rin ripa (s0.Danuv1·2·) . . .
secl (etiam). This ellipsis is, perhaps, more frequent in Tacitus than
in previous writers. The omission of any mention of the Raetian
limes, on which they in reality bordered, is probably due to the fact
that this part of the frontier fortifications had not yet been finished
when the Germania was written.

22. penitus: sar beyond, deep inland on the other side of the
river. atque etc, : a concrete statement, added to define the vague
expression penitus, Cp. Incrod. p. lxviii. splendidissima . . .
colonia: Augsusca I'z‘nclelz'corum, the modern Augsburg, founded by
Augustus about 12 Ad). Strictly speaking, it was a onwzz'cz'pz'um, not a

colonia; but by the time of Tacitus these ternis were used promis-
cuously in the sense of oppidum or civitas.
