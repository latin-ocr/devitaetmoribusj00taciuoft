294 CRITICAL APPENDIX.

this conjecture is refuted by the epigram (primi— vincuntur), which,
as usual in this treatise, marks the close 01 a chapter.

is, however, equally probable that mfama vera. represents the original,
the et being, in that case, due to scriptura concinna (nsquef'ama) ‚· si
is, in any case, quite unjustifiable. Cp. Ayr. 30, 23 1. ; 33, 23.

or with ellipsis 01 moris est, but possibly Tacitus wrote uc in barbaris

passage has given rise.

45, 29ff. H. Schiitz, followed eg. by Muellenlioff, Zernial, and
Wolff, have placed the words Suionibus—degsenerccnc after eh. 44, 24.
The reasoning which proinpted so bold a conjecture has been refuted
by Ι. F. Marcks, Festschr. ‚zur 43. Vei-samnii. ‹zeum-h. Plzz‘lol. zu K'o’In,
1805, p. 177 ff„ but the transpositum is equally untenable on external
grounds. (1) It is paleographically out 01 1110 question. (2) Chapter
44 already eloses with an epigra1n3 on the other hand, it is not
probable that the entire description 01 Suebia froni 011. 38-44, would
have ended without one. (3) Such a transposition must 001101010111151
include the clause Hic Suebiae fiius, but this would be absurd after
011. 44, 24, as the Suebie Aestii are subsequently discussed, and at the
sanie time 011. 46 would open too abruptly, without any hint being
given that the following tribes are non-Suebie. (4) Hz'c ›S'nebz'ae finis
cannot follow directly upon the close of a non-geographical excursus.
(5) And finally, the advocates 01 the transposition are compelled to
change Suionas (ch. 45, 25) to Sitonas, a procedure 01 itself sufficient
to vindicate the MS. tradition.

45, 32. Hic Suebiae finis has hitherto been taken as the begin-
ning 01 ch. 46. 11 seems to ine, however, to be inore appropriately
placed at the close 01 the long account 01 1110 Suebi.
