’ Pion: 38] NoTEs. CHAPTER 12. 197

vzze›·9e1·ecu1·‚· IV. 50, 4. The following lines in Matthew Arnold's
Balcler Deacl are evidently inspired by the present passage :-

Cowards who were in sloughs interred alive,

And round them still the wattled hurdles hung,
Wherewith they stamped them down and trod them deep
'so hide their shameful memory from men. Υ

insuper: here, ch. 16, 29; 34, 22, to be taken in a local sense, but
in the remaining twenty-five instances in Tacitus, it means more-
over, as eg. in ch. 2⁷31, 18; 45, 1.

22. tamquam introducing a substantive clause is a peculial· post-
Augustan substitute i'or the accusative with infinitive. lt is most
frequent iu Tacitus3 in the minor works only here3 ch. 20. 4 ; 39, 20 ;
Dial. 10. 6. 25 ; 25, 11. Excepting a doubtful passage iu Nep. IIann.

inference of the idealizing author or his authority. Cp. Incrod. p. lxiii.

23. levioribus delictis: eg. homicide, assault and battery, lar-
ceny, personal libel. pro modo: sc. delicti. poena: all these
transgressions could be atoned for by the payment ot' a fine, the so-
called WersseId, which in old Germanic laws is regulated by numerous
gradations, in proportion to the magnitude and character of the
offence on the oue hand, and the social and politica] position of the
injured party on the other.

24. equorum . . . multantur: this can, of course, have been
true only of the well-to-dO. Among the lower classes, the fine must,
even in Tacitus* time, have been money.

25. regizprz‘ncz’pz', elze'ef; used a ιΐωνῐῖυνὶ. Cp. note ch. 10, 20.
Probably where there were several principes ot equal rank, part of the
fine was paid to the tribal community. The fractional distribution,
as later documents show, varied at different times and among different
peoples. In monarchical Scandinavia the king received one third, the
