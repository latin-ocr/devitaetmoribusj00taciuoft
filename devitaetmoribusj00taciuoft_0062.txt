esteem by Tacitus,l and Livy's description of Britain was
demonstrably known to him, while Sallust served as his
model for historical composition.2 There can, therefore, be
no doubt that he was not likely to have ignored any-
thing these famous historians had written concerning
Germany.

But that Sallust had given an account of the tribes and
customs of Germany in an excursus of his Hz'storz'es, usually
cited by grammarians under the title of (Ze sita Pontico, is
an arbitrary assumption which is in no way strengthened
by the incidental mention of the word Germani in two
isolated fragments.3

Livy—Libys, on the other hand, did deal at some length
with the geography and customs of (161*1111111γ.4 But as his
sources can have been none other than Caesar and probably
Posidonius⁵ it were rash to assert, in the absence of all
definite clews, that Tacitus is ‹lirectly indebted to Livy, nor
has his style left any but faint impressions upon the later
historian.6
