288 CRITICAL APPENDIX.

hesitation in making the change in accordance with the consistent
usage of Tacitus, on which see Introcl. p. lxviii. The two conjunctions
are habitually confounded in our MSS.; so eg. ch. 7, 13.

5, 30. Argentum quoque] Araentmnque--IL Schiitz. And be-
sides, mereover, is a frequent meaning of initial -que If quoque were
correct, sequuntur quoquc (amentum, eto, would have been called for.
Quoque and -quc are also repeatedly confused in our MSS. Cp. e.g.
Dz'al. ch. 22, 32, locosque for locos quoque; 34, 25, hodie quoquc for
hodieque ‚‘ Liv. I. 17, 193 XL. 12, 10.

8, 2-1. Albrunam] †Alb›·11mzm. The name is hopelessly cor-
rupted in our MSS, the generally accepted emendation of lVacker-
nagel being based upon a purely conjectura] etymology. See also
note ad loc.

9, 30. liburnae] liburniccw. See PH. p. 30 f.

10, 10. consultetur] consulitur —— Walch ; consuletur — MSS.
See note ad loc.

10, 22. sed apud proceres: sacerdotes enim] α. p. sed a. s.,
se enim. Halm, Controverse Stellen, eto, in Berz'clzte der Miinch.
Alma. 1864, p. 30, suggested the transposition of sed. It is omitted
before (1191ch anceres in all but two MSS, one of these being of no
authority. The particle was doubtless written above the line in the
archetype, and hence some scribes inserted it in the wrong place,
the great majority overlooking it altogether. Se enim, on the other
hand, is found in all the MSS. See also note ad loe.

10, 25. explorant] explorantur—B, exploraffir—Assss. The
passive plural seems to me preferable. Similar variants, owing to
abbreviations of the endings, are exceedingly common in MSS. In
this treatise, eg. the following readings, ch. 6, 12, clz'stz'nssuuntw·,· 27,
25, observatur ,· 44, 7, rcsflmnc,· 45, 30, differuntur, are untenable.

11, 1. praetractentur] pertragtentur—MSS„ except CD2V. The
error was due to the abbreviation pr. Cp. PII. p. 40.
11, 9. turba] turbae — MSS. The conJ'ecture of Gronovius,

though accepted by many, is rendered impossible by the context of
the preceding clause. Ut tto-bac placuit is but another vicium ex
libertate. If this hypothetical chan-man could have called the great
assembly to order (for with turba placuit we must supply praesidi)
whenever he saw what appeared to him a sufficiently large number to
constitute a ‘quor-unis the phrase nec uc iussi conveniunt would
involve a contradictimi.
11, 11. princeps] principes—Perizonius. Cp. PII. p. 40.
