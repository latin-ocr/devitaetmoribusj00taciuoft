188 NOTEs. CHAPTER 9. [PAGE 37

was also part of the Dionysus cult and generally very widespread
seems to have been unknown to Tacitus or his authorities. signum
ipsum: the very symbol of the goddess as distinct from the cerelnony
connected with her. liburnicae: sc. navis. It was possibly the
‚tbreigsn character of the vessel (see note ΑΨ. 28, 8), not the vessel as
such, which led to the hypothesis.

Paga 37, 1. advectam: either by land or sea, for the verb is
used in both senses. The question cannot be decided here, as it de—
pends, in a measure, upon the location of the pars Sueborum. If
understood of the upper Danube. the former would be implied ; if in
Flanders, the latter would be possible. On the whole, it seems that
Tacitus would have decided that the cult was intrfflluced overland, for
in ch. 2, 14, he is speaking of whole migrations in prelzsz‘storie times,
whereas the Roman Isis cult was of comparatively recent date (Second
Punic lVar). religionem: of barbarian religious beliefs, Tacitus
generally uses the term supersticio, but the worship of Isis, though
originally Egyptian, had by this time become closely associated with
Roman religion, not to mention that in the present case the cult was
supposed to have been imported. Ceterum: bat to return co their
own dez'cz'es (‹Z‹2‹n·z‹m-‹leos); on this use of the particle, see note 2, 11.
On such fanciful reflections see note ch. 7, 5 and Introd. p. lxiii.

2. cohibere parietibus: the statement is, of course, self-evident
among a people who were just emerging from a pastoral 01· nomadic
state. Thus the very word templum (from temno, co cut off) originally
denoted merely a sacred enclosure, and this is still the only meaning
in Lucretius. A very similar explanation is given by Cic. [Ze rep. III.
9, 14, and Min. Felix, Octav. 32, 1. humani oris, etc: this was
probably still true of the Germ-ans in general in Tacitus' time, for even
the Goths of the 4th century had not yet advanced beyond rude sym-
bols (ξόανα), and such was doubtless the numen ipsum in ch. 40, 15.

4. lucos ac nemora: the same collocation occurs in Tacitus again,
ch. 10, 18; 45, 213 and in Dc‘al. 12, 29, with secretum following, as
here. These sacred groves are often referred to, e. g. ch. 39, 133 40,
5; 43, 24; Anac. ΙΙ. 12; IV. 73. On the adversative asyndeton, see
Introd. p. lxvii. nominibus: instrumental ablative.

5. secretum illud, etc. ι that myscem'onspresence which they behold
solely in tha» spii-ic of devotion. The awe-inspiring influence of silvan
silence was not lost upon the Romans, as many passages attest, eg.
Sen. Epist. 41, 33 Lucan, ΙΙΙ. 4113 Quint. X. 1, 88. The epigram-
