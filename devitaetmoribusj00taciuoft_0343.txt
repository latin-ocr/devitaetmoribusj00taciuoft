Romans at Ticinus, the Trebia, Lake Trasimene. and above all Cannae
(216 Bo). non Hispaniae: the reference is to the severe losses
sustained by the Romans in the Celtiberiam and Lusitanian revohs,
under Viriathus. and before Numantia (154-139 13.c.). Galliaeve :
as Caesar's campaigns are referred to below, the allusion is here more
probably to the battle of the Allia, the sack of Rome (390-389 13.c.), the
Gallie wars during 238-236 and 226-222. particularly the bloody battle
of Clusium (225 B.c.). though this latter eventually ended with a
Roman victory. The change from the singular to the plural. from the
names of people to the names of countries, is a Tacitean device to
avoid monotony. Cp, esp. Anu. ΙΙ, 60, Libya Aethiopia Medisque et
Persis et Bactriano α(- Scytha potitum„

10. ne Parthi quidem ι Rome's struggles with Parthia, begun
under Caesar, had practically come to an end in the reign of Augustus.
ne . . . quidem often closes an anaphoric or asyndetic enumeration, eg.
ch. 28. 24; Dz'al. 40. 14. saepius admonuere : sounded a more
frequent alat-m ς 1116 verb is used absolutely, as here, also Ami.
XV. 45.

11. regno : desl‘wtism. The word is never used by Tacitus except
of barbarian monarchies. Arsacis: the founder of the Parthian
dynasty in 2236 13.c., which lasted till 226 A.I)., when it was supplanted
by the Sassanidae, the name having assumed a titul-ar meaning, as
Caesar. Note the chiasnius. acrior : Ims α keener ecl-(se.

12. caedem Crassi: M. Crassus, the triumvir, was cruelly put to
death by the Parthians at the battle of Carrhae (in Mesopotamia),
June 9, 53 B.c. et ipse, {iheu-ise, belongs to Oriens, as if the abla-
tive absolute were an aorist active participle 111 1116 nominative (καὶ
αὐτὸς Πάκορον ἀπολέσας). This usage. extremely rare elsewhere, occurs
repeatedly in Tacitus. Cp. note Assr. 25, 7, dii-[so ec ipse . . . ezei-cita.

13. Pac6roz Pacorch, the fourteenth of the Arsacid dynasty, son
of Orodes, the ally of Brutus and Cassius, was defeated ancl slain by
Ventidius in 38 Bc, according to tradition on the very day of Crassus'
death. infra Ventidium : P. Ventidius Bassus, at one time a mule-
teer, became pontifex maximus, praetor, aud finally consul in 44 mu,
through the influence of Caesar. As leyacus of Antony he secured
a triumph over the Parthians, and on his death was honored with a
public funeral. Tacitus means to say that the Orient more than atoned
for the murder of Crassus, by the loss of Pacorus, and by being, as
an additional 1111111111311011, trodden under foot by a man of Ventidius'
antecedents. obiecerit: can cast into our leeth.
