PAGE 38] NOTES. CHAPTER 11. 193

de maioribus: perhaps those enumerated 111 ch. 22, 2 fl, to which
may be added elections of the princeps or dua: (ch. 7, 29), and ques-
tions involving life and death.

31. omneszoi πάντες, the plebs. So frequently, especially in
antithesis. Cp. ch. 17. 43 40, 43 Dial. 40. 18. ea quoque, etc:
i.e. res maiores.

Page 38, 2. nisi quid fortuitum et subitum incidit : except in
tlte case. osan zcneapeeted and sudden emergsencgl. The two adjectives
are often combined, as in Dz'al. 10, 303 Ann. XV. 58, but usually in
the sense of extemporaneous speech. certis diebus: see note
ch. 9, 26.

3. incohatur luna aut impletur: on the medial position of the
noun between two verbs, cp. note, Disd. 37, 53 Introd. Agsr. p. xxvi.
The calculation by lunai· months invariably antedates the solar calen-
dar, the new or full moon being, moreover, among most races regarded
as particularly propitious. So the Spartans refused to fight before the
full moon (Herod. VI. 106), and Ariovistus awaited the new moon
before engaging in battle (Caes. B. [τ’. Ι. 50. 4). 'l‘aoitus does not state
that these meetings took place every two weeks, and they probably
did not, —-but simply that they would not be called except at such
a time for the reason given. Cp. the Anglo-Saxon Andreas 157 f. z
they held ever count-il (efter th 111-1] nsahts.

4. agendis rebus: fin· tlte litans-arcion of business, to be taken
generally, not merely with reference to the folkonooc or assembly.
The final dative of the gerundive, after an adjective, occurs 111 the
minor writings only here3 after verbs, Am·- 23, 253 31, 11 3 45, 223
and once after a noun, Assr. 22, 9. In the later works, ull these con-
structions are exceedingly common. ι auspicatissimum initium:
so similarly, Quint. X. 1, 85, α. (πι-οιϊῖίιωη.

5. Nec z non ideo, und hence. So often in Tacitus. noctium:
this was the natural outcome of reckoning time by the moon’s changes.
It is still in vogue in Arabian and Hebrew ritual, and is attributed by
Mam-ob, Sat. Ι. 3, to the Athenians of historical times. Engl. fortnz‘gsht,
sennisflzc (now obsolete), twelfiflz nz‘ffld, lzfdlouw'en, Germ. Wez'lcndclzten
(Christmas)‚ Fascnccclzc (Lent), are all survivals of the same custom.
Cp. also Caes. B. (τ’. VI. 18. 2, of the Gauls, spacia omnis temporis
rnon numero dierum sed noctium finiunt. In Greek and Norse my-
thology the day is accordingly conceived as the son of night.

6. Sic constituunt. sic condicunt: sc. diem, i.e. under these
