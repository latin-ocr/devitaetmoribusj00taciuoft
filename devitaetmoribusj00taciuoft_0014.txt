viii INTRODUCTION. 11.

His design of writing the history of Augustus1 and of
Nerva and Trajan² seems to have been frustrated by his
death, at least no such works existed in the time of St.
Jerome (fourth century).

H.
THE LITERARY CHARACTER OF THE AGRICOLA.3

The opening chapter of the introduction deals exclusively
with the biographical and autobiographical treatises of
former times, the Asso-[cola being expressly designated as a
'vita defuncte? hominis at its close. Two other instances of
biography are ,added at the beginning of the second chapter,
and 111 the epilogue the biographical character of his work
is again emphasized by the author.4 But 111 spite of these
explicit statements, modern scholars have persistently re-
fused to accept Tacitus's own classification of this work,
on the ground that the treatise flagrantly violates certain
alleged canons of biographical composition, which must, of
course, either have been unknown to Tacitus or deliberately
ignored by him. But when the problem arose of assigning
to it a more suitable designation, a great diversity of opinion
was revealed, partly due to an habitual confusion with the
question as to the purpose of the treatise. Eliininating
this for the present from the discussion as irrelevant, we
find that the principa] objections against the assumption
that the Aqrzcola is a bzssoqrcephy resolve themselves into two.
