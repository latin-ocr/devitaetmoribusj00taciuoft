292 CRITICAL APPENDIX.

archaism be thought inadinissible‚ if we write visui (sc. Romanorum),
a conjecture which scarcely involves any change at all (visunova).
&Vc thus secure a perfectly Tacitean asyndeton bimembre. Semper
may now be legitiinately supplied, nam, etc., pointing out that this
peculiar attire of the Chatti was always a source of astonishment to
the Romans, because it was retained even in times of peace.

33, 15. urguentibus] umentibus. This is demonstrably the more
correct orthography.

35, 2. recedit] fredit-MSS. Siinply because of a parallel use
of recedere in Pomp. Mela, ΙΙΙ. 1, 8, editors have followed Heraeus in
rejecting a wholly unobjectionable word against the unanimous tes-
timony of tlie MSS. But, not to mention that an emendation not
called for by textual corruption, excellent though it be, is ipso facto
false, the same figurative use of redire is found not only in Vei-g.
Geor-(J. ΠΙ. 351, a noteworthy parallelism in view of the extensive
indebtedness of Tacitus to Vergilian phraseology (see Introd. p. lxx),
but it actually occurs twice in none other than Mela himself. See
note ad loc.

35, 10. The repeated collocation in Tacitus of raptus and Iatro-
cz'm'a leaves no doubt in niy mind that 110 here, also, as elsewhere,
wrote et (ccc) not aut.

35, 11. idque, at the beginning of a sentence, is far more com-
mon than id in Tacitus. Cp. esp. Hisc. IV. 36, idque. 111 aecz'puum.

another instance of a familiar haplography.

35, 13. poscat (exercitus), plurimum] poscat, suffercitus (sc. est.)
plurimorum. This simple emendation of the much niolested passage
merely involves the assumption of an easily neglected solution of a
compendium. The deletion of exercitus, 011 the other hand, is methodi-
cally quite unjustifiable, as are all the other changes hitherto proposed.
Nor can exerc-[tus be taken as the obJ'ect of poseat, for si (ut, prout) res
poscit is a forinulaic parenthesis of especially frequent occurrence in
Tacitus.

36, 20. superiori] superioris—MSS. A certain instance of the
dative with nomen, though exceedingly common in other writers, is
perhaps found in Tacitus only cli. 43, 27, the s immediately following
