new idea to the preceding„ but serves as a kind of apology for hav—
ing mentioned at all what might have been taken for granted in tanto
viro.

18. famam . . . indulgent: a commonplace. Cp. Cic. pro

change of construction for the sake of variety, see [nm-ad. p. xxxiv. —

21. conlegas: more particularly the governors of the neighbor-
ing provinces, such as Gallia Narbonensis and Gallia Lugdunensis.
procuratores: probably a rhetorical plural for sake of symmetry
with conlegms. See note ch. 5, 4. —Observe the careful libration οἳ
these two clauses. vincere inglorium . . . adteri sordidum: to
be taken only in reference to quarrels with the procuratores, who
were inferior in rank to the legsacns. -With the sentiment cp. Sen.

22. minus triennium: Dio Cass. L11.23‚ 2‚ gives the period of
tenure ot' provincial governors as not less than three 1101· more than
five years. The factthat Agricola. was leuatus pro praecora 101· even
less than the usual period probably accounts for the renewed expecta-
tion that his election to the consulship would follow immediately, his
hope being originally based on the fact that he was governor of Aqui-
tania. See note ch. 9, 5.

23. ad spem, etc: i.e. he was recalled to Rome⁷ cherishing the
hope of an immediate appointment to the consulship. statim, in
place of the missing adjective, is joined to spem, this being equivalent,
to res· sperat«, as in Verg. Georss. IV. 1623 Ovid, Heroz‘d. XVII. 182.

25. dari: the present infinitive implies the correctness of the
belief⁷ although it was as yet based only on opinio, not actual infor-
mation7 a circumstance still further emphasized by the poetic quota-

tion. in hoc: owing to the verbal force in sermonibus an elliptical
abl. abs. par: because Agricola was the best fitted for the office.
