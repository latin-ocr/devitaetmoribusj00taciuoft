Again, if, as many scholars maintain, the Germania was
primarily designed for Trajan, and secondarily sor the
Roman public, then Tacitus' treatise was nothing less than
an act of 11›resumption and supererogation, for whatever
Trajan's plans may have been, he was certainly in excep-
tionally favorable circumstances 10 learn at first 11111111 what
the author of the Germania could only have ascertained at

the tribes beyond the Elbe, and of the remote North, would
have been both useless and irrelevant, for even 111 1116 wild-

To these considerations, quite sufficient to disprove the
hypothesis of the political purpose of the Germania, two
others may be added which, though equally strong, have
hitherto been overlooked.

The object of the historical retrospect in ch. 37, which

hands of northern barbarians within a period of two centuries,

Tacitus could only enhance the effectiveness of the treatise. . .
Everything, and even this silence, thus points to this ai1n.⁷' By such
reasoning almost anything could be demonstrated.
