16. soliti plerumque: a pleonasm of frequent occurrence3 eg.
Lucret. ΙΙ. 954 ; Caes.. R. C. III. 8, 23 Sall. Isssl- 7, 5. eventibus:
here, suceesses. Sec note ch. 8, 30.

17. pensare (Σ υουψρηεανρ, which does not occur in Tacitus) is
chiefly poetic and rust-Augustam iuxtazparz'ter, aeque. So
used 111 six other passages of Tacitus, but 111 the smaller works only
here. ’

18. Agricola, etc. : this seemingly irrelevant paragraph is added
at this particular point in the narrative, because the above-mentioned
successes were won at some distance from headquarters, and without
the general's previous knowledge or upon his initiative, a fact ut1lized
by the biographer to emphasize certain noteworthy qualities of Agric-
ola, which this circumstance had revealed, and his readiness to
bestovv praise in turn naturally leads to a brief statement concerning
his temper generally. Cp. Imm-od. p. xii.

19. centurio . . . praefectus: Officers of the infantry and cav-
alry respectively. inconruptum . . . testem habebat: used co
‚find in him ((11, ἰνιιρανῐῖαῖ escsitzatm· (αρρναῖδεν) ⁰s his deod, testis
being here used in a very peculial· sense3 for this conduct was, of
course, not emitined to achievements which he actually witnessed, as
is clear from the¹ context.

20. Apud Ξ incer. Cp. note ch. 21, 3.

21. et: et reru, (tud ἱη ficet. Cp. Ch. 10, 12. bonis . . . ad-
versus malos: on the change of construction, characteristic of Taci-
tus, see Introd. p. xxxiv. iniucundus: not elsewhere used in
Tacitus, and very rarely applied to persons; eg. Quint. X. 1, 124. ——
With the statement, (tp. Xen. Ayes. 11, 10, πραότατὸς ’γε μὴν φίλοις ὤν,
ἐχθροῖς φοβερώτατος ἣν.

22. secretum. etc. ι i.e. unlike eg. Domitian (ch. 39, 17 ; 42. 20)
and Tiberius (Ani). Ι. 69, odia in Zonqum iaciens quae reconderet
aeremque promeret), he gave expression to his indignation when in

anger, but did not secretly cherish any further resentment. ut
. . timeres: for the subjunctive, cp. ch. 12, 31, ut internosces.
23. offendere . . . odisse: on the alliterative antithesis, cp.

luti-ml. p. xxviii.

Chapter 23. 25. Quarta aestas: i.e. 81 ,1.1). obtinendis:
the final dative with gerundive is very rare in the minor works. Cp.
ch. 22, 93 31, 11 ; 45, 22, und (am-m- 11, 4.
