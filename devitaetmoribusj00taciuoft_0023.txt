LITERARY CHARACTER OF THE AGRICOLA. XVii

The Historical Retrospect.—5. Σύγκρισις. Immediately
upon the account of the ethnology and geography of Britain
there follows in our treatise a fairly detailed retrospect
concerning the predecessors of Agricola (011. 13-18), and it,
too, 1133 been prononnced out of place 111 3 biography. But
this objection is also unwarrantffl, for here again Tacitus
strictly conforms to the rules for the βασιλικὸς λόγος, the
historical snrvey being clearly in the nature of 3 σύγκρισις
01· comparison, which is invariably given 33 311 integral
part of the biographical encomium.I And that Tacitus him-
self regarded these and the preceding Chapters as legitimate
and essential is indicated by ch. 18, 17, hunc Britanniae
statum, has bellorum vices Agyricolw ‚ . . ina-enit, with which
words he introduces the πράξεις ἐν πολέμῳ of his hero.

The σύγκρισις 13 preferably infide to follow the πράξεις and
is placed immediately before the- ἐπίλογος,2 but its position
was not definitely fixed3 and Tacitus was therefore perfectly
at liberty to insert it where he chose, without violating
any rhetorical standards. With that keen eye for effec-
tive (ll-amatio grouping which distinguishes him above all

 

among ancient historialis took the greatest pains in regard to the
topography and strategio movements of a battle, do not wholly satisfy
modern standards of accuracy and clearness‚ for they, too, occasionally
succumbed to the temptation of rhetorical embellislnnent.
