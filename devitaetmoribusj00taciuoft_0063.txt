THE 50110οΕ5 OF THE GERMANIA. lvii

But even granting that the Germania was under 0011-
siderably greater obligations to the authors discussed above²
than the evidence will wal-rant us in assuming, there still
remains a class of topics, and they are among the most
valuable and interesting in the entire treatise, which are
not so much as alluded to in any 01 our extant sources. Ι

and ritual. This information must have been based upon
the researches 01 some scholar who devoted special atten-
tion to topics 01 this kind, and it is, therefore, not without
significance that Tacitus, particularly in these chapters,
repeatedly refers, contrary to his usual reticence, to some

the plurals, like ἔνιοι, φασί, and the like, in Greek, do not necessarily
