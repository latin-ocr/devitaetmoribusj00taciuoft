times, if for no other reason than that the ability to speak in public
could not well have been possessed by them.

12. prout nobilitas: as the principes were all nobiles, this
passage implies, and the later history of Germanic institutions fully
confirms it. that not all nobles were of caica] rank. Cp. also eh. 13. 4,
z'nsiynis nobilitas.

13. auctoritate . . . potestate: note the effective chiasmus,
and cp. for the thought, ch. Τ, 1.

14. sententia: an opinion, a speech. fremitu adspernantur:
they repudiate with a loud slmut Adspernari is a very strong expres-
sion. Cp. Hist. III. 10. fremitu et clamore . . . adspernantur.

15. frameas z see ch. 6, (5. concutiunt: clash. by striking the
spear-points together. The same custom, to signify approval, pre-
vailed among the Gauls. Cp. Caes. B. (τ’. VII. 21, 1, suo more armis
concrepat (sc. multitudo) quod fircera> in co consuerunt cuius oratio-
nem adprobant. In the north this was called by a technical term,
vapnatalc. honoratissimum, etc.: the superlative implies that
there were also other but less emphatic modes of assent, as the stamp-
ing of feet. Cp. Hist. V. 17, ubi sono armorum tripudiisque (ita
Germanis mos) adprobata sunt dicta.

Chapter 12, This paragraph, the locus classicus of the Germanic,
penal code, is a model of condensation, though tantalizingly brief for
modern scholars.

17. Licet: it is lauzr'ul, not merely equivalent to concessum est.
It is used in place of fas est, because these J'udicial functions of the
foll-'moon 01· large assembly, were probably not exercised under a
religious sanction. On this meaning os licet. cp. Cic. Phil. XIII. 6.
14, licere id dicimus quod Ieffl‘bus. quod ynore maiorum institutisque
conceditur. accusare quoque: i.e. besides being a deliberative
body, the assembly also constituted the criminal court of J'ustice in
matters involving the death penalty. If such crimes had been known
to come up for final disposition in the local courts, presided over by
the principes mentioned below, Tacitus would have written concilium
quoque or licet quoque. discrimen capitis intendere: to threaten
with capital punishment is added to the general term accusare for the
sake of closer definition. See Introd. p. lxviii. The phrase, like litem,
crimen, periculum, actionem intendere, is a legal technical term. The
verb in this sense occurs first 111 Lucret. ΙΙΙ, 950. the metaphor being
probably taken from the bending of the bow.
