in earlier Latin, eg. Cic. de fin.. 5123, (383 Sall. Illy. 43. 1 ; Liv. IV.
53, 1. Tacitus has more than seventy inslanceS.

3. suorum: neuter. -—— With this often repeated sentiment, cp.
Ami. lI'. ὃὸ, dum vetera extollimus, recentium z'ncaec›·iosi; and the exx.

Tacitus. See note on vetus, ch. 2, 6.

7. pronum magisque in aperto : metaphors taken froin a field
which lies open and offers no obstacles to advancement, i.e. those
