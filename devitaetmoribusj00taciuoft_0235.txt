follows, because of the anaphora, noster—nostrum—nobis.—The
reference is more particularly to Tacitus and his wife.

4. condicione: owing] to, tlzrouqlz che circumstance, the noun
taking the place of a preposition, like beneficio (Diui. 8. 29),0]16
(Hisc. IV. 24), merito (Hz'st. V. 4).—On the absence of Tacitus
between 89—5‘k3s4, see note ch. 42, 4 and Introd. p. vi.

5. ante quadriennium z quadriennio ante, a very common idi‹›m
in Tacitus and post-Augustan Latin generally. It occurs first in
Nepos, Dat. 11, un'e aliquot dies. Ante and likewise post gradually
lost their adverbia} character, and were regarded only as prepositifms.
Omnia . . . superfuere honori tuo: all Nm ministraticus af affee-
tion were thiae in ubuudauce. In this sense houm· is Vergilian, but
rare. Cp. Aeu. XII. 5613, si quis Amatae Tanai! honos (mz'mum. —
With the meaning of superfuere, ep. Germ. 6, 4 ;’ 26, 18; IIssl. Ι. 51,
and note cli. 44, 25.

7. comploratus z simul ploratus. The earliest instance of this
usage, for cum in composition with a verb either intensifies or is equiv-
alent to inter se. The present meaning of the cmnpound is a Grae-
cism, especially common with verbs denoting sorrow or mourning, and
hence the very few similar instances found in Latin, before Tertullian
and other African writers, occur in what are evident translations, eg.
Ter. ild. Prol. 6; Cic. Top. 53, 12.

8. aliquid pathetically expresses the condition of the sick man.
who, already in the shadow of death, is yet dimly conscious of the
absence of his only child.

Chapter 46. 10. Si quis piorum, etc. z the belief in a hereafter
for the virtuous and the good has found frequent expression in the
ancient poets and philosophers, one of the earliest literary passages
being Eur. Alc. 744 fi, Εἰ δέ τι κάκεῖ meon ἔστ’ ἀγαθοῖς, δῖα, and in
Roman writers, Plaut. Tre'n. 542.» f., Fortuuutorum memorant insulas
quo cuncti, qui aetatem eyerz'nt caste suam, conveniunt. —The state-
ment of a transference to the Elysian fields is prescribed for the
cncomz'zmn by the rhetorician Menander, Rleet. Gr. ΠΙ. 414, 16 Sp.
See also Introcl. p. xiX. ut sapientibus placet: i.e. the philoso—
phers, more particularly, it would seem, the Stoic Chrysippus.

12. nosque et domum: on que—et, a favorite collocation in
Tacitus, when the pronoun precedes, cp. note eh. 18, 10. desi-
derio . . . lamentis, etc.. correspond chiastically to uos and (ionum
(Agricola's wife and daughter). Such injunctions to survivors seen]
