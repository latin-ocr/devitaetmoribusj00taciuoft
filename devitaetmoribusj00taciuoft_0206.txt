IV. 62 3 Lucret. V. 816 ; Quint. X. 1, 993 Plin. Epis-t. VI. 20, 14. The

monplaces characteristic of military speechcs, see Introd. p. xxxvi.

15. in frontem z proyredz'cncibus, which was avoided for euphonic
reasons, sumentibus following. The phrase is unparalleled, but ἰη
often has the meaning totvm-ds, and the term was probably coined on
the analogy of tergm praebere, which signifies ssight in battle, even
without the addition of hostibus. —On the ellipsis oi scd, extremely
common 111 antitheses of this kind, see Introd. p. xxxi.

ἀποθάνωμεν, καλὸν τὸ μνημεῖον τὴν Βρεταννίαν ἕξομεν.
