250 NOTES. CHAPTER 33. [PAGE 49

from ema nos, or dative. The ablative of the thing is expressly stated
by Quint. IX. 3, 1, to be post—Ciceronian. Tacitus has both construc-
tions, but there is only one instance of the dative of the thing, viz. Ann.
XIII. 53, inridit operi, where opere, however, may be the original.

11. sexaginta milia . . . ceciderunt: i.e. on both sides.
Tacitus usually avoids large round numbers. See note Assr. 37, 11.
Here his ardent patriotism got the better of him.

12. armis telisque: the specific term is added to the generic and
both balanced with oblectationi oculisque. Cp. note ch. 29, 8, and
Introd. p. lxviii.

13. oblectationi oculisque ι sar che delz‘yht os our eyes, as if the
carnage had been witnessed in a Roman amphitheatre. Elsewhere
Tacitus is very severe on gladiatorial exhibitions, 011 the ground of
their demoralizing influence. The final dative with intransitive verbs,
other than esse, though not uncommon in the later works, is found in
the minor writings only here and Aslr. 31, 12. On the addition of the
concrete noun by way of definitior] of an abstract substantive, cp.
Dz'al. 22, 13, visum ec oculos aelectec,· Cio. (le orac. III. 44, 73, delec-
tationis atque aurium causa ,· Val. Flacc. VIII. 60 ; and Incrocl. p. lxviii.
Thongh conveniently translated as hendiadys, the phrase is not con—
ceived as such, as shown by armis telisque, with which it is librated.
With the savage sentiment, cp. Seu. (Ze ira, 11. 5, 4, Hannibalem aiunt
dixisse, cum fossam scmgsuz'ne humano plenam vidisset: 0 formosum

14. gentibus: the word is here well on its way to its later
meaning of forez'yners. si non . . . at certe : a frequent collocation
in TacituS.

15. quando: since, a common meaning, but in the minor works
of Tacitus only here. urgentibus . . . fatis: with the sate os
empire pushinq 011, 111 accordance with the historical mission of
Rome, crystallized in the memor-able passage of Verg. Aen. VI. 851 ff„
cu reyere imperio populos, Romane, memento, etc. 3 for that Tacitus,
unlike eg. Amm. Marc. XXXI. 1, 4, had as yet not even a vague pre—
sentiment, as is generally inferrecl from this passage, that the empire
might some day succumb to ‘the attacks of these northern barbarians,
is clearly shown by Hisc. IV. 54 (written perhaps ten years after the
Germania), Captum olz'm α Gallis urbem, sed zssntessra Iovis sede
