THE SOURCES OF THE GERMANIA. lix

That the works of Posidonius, more particularly the
exhaustive account of the Cimbri and Teutones, must have
constituted a welcome repository of trustworthy informa-
tion on Germany can still be shown, for apart from the fact
already pointed out, that the above-mentioned narrative
remained the standard treatment of those tribes, we owe to
Posidonius the first mention of the name Germaffl and the
first description of that coniiti‘y.2

Under these circumstances, it does not seem probable that
Tacitus would have failed to avail himself of the labors of
so 161131116, 30 suggestive, and so learned an authority, whose
very attitude of mind and point of view, moreover, as inani-
fested, e.g.‚ in his tendency 10 idealize barbarian races, must
have been singularly sympathetic to our author.³ Although
the precise nature and extent of this indebtedness must, of
course, remain problematical‚ there is at least one piece of
detailed information in the Germania for which Posidonius
seems reasonably certain to have been, if not the direct, yet
the ultimate source.

 

lAthen. IV. p. 153 6. Mullenhoff, D. A. II. pp. 153 ff„ intent
upon proving 11131- Caesar was the first to distinguish the Celts from
the Germans, is finally driven 10 the arbitrary hypothesis that Athe-
naeus interpolated the name into his direct citation from Posidonius‚
and that Strabo, Valerius Maximus, Velleius, and Diodorus all wan—
tonly changed the 1611113 Γαλαταί, Κελτοί, or Galli, given in their
sources, 10 Germani. But Caesar was already acquainted with the
latter designation before he encountered German 1111163, and as he
regards the Cimbri and Teutones as Germanic, nothing is more
plausible than that their great historian⁷ Posidonius, had done so
too. Cp. also Philol. LVIII. p. 29. Caesar knew but few trans-
Rhenish people intimately‚ and, if he clearly differentiated these from
the Celtic Gauls, it does not follow that he had determined the racial
distinctions of the German peoples as a whole, as Tacitus did, on the
strength of the extensive information at his disposal.
