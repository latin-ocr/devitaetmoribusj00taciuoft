Chapter 9, 26. Deorum maxime Mercurium colunt: so
exactly Caes. B. (τ’. VI. 17, 1, (lemn maxime illei-curium colunt. The
attributes enumerated by him, l.c., huna ommium inventorem artium

part 111 Wodan's broad-brimmed hat, 1116 cadmeas in his staff; both

to Posidonius. 11 was still accepted as late as the 8111 century. The
worship of Wodan, as the supreme deity, was, however, not pan-Ger-
manic, at least not at this time, nor does Tacitus, as is generally supposed,
really mean this, as Deorum marimo for (lenm maa-[mum shows ; but

the time of new or full moon (ch. 11, 3) or at the solstices. The inter-

all primitive rituals, the substitution of animals being invariably a
sign of cultural progress, although sporadic instances continue to
occur in later historical times. Cp. l‘lut. leem. 13, and Quaest. Rom.

sively confined to the Wodan cult is clear from Tacitus himself. Cp.
ch. 39, 15 ; 40, 15, and Anu. XIII. 57, where the custom of sacrificing
the defeated foe, Marci ccc Mercurio, is ascribed to the Hermunduri
and Chatti. Herculem : cp. note ch. 3, 17.

(ch. 43, 25) with the Germanic god of war, Tz'u or Zz'u. Cp. Engl.
