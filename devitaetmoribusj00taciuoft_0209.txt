16. pellerentur: sc. aicxilia, which, though easily supplied from
the context, would probably have been expressed had not azixz‘lium
preceded. in speciem simul ac terrorem: observe that what Cal-
gacus had warned against and ridiculed, ne terreat vanus adspectus et
. . . faiqor (ch. 32, 13), is here asserted to have been resorted to by
the Caledonians themselves.—cerror is the result of specieS, and
simul is used to indicate their belief that cause and effect would be

XXXI. 21, 14.

23. futura erat: migsht prove to be, a frequent meaning of the
future participle. For quamquam with the indicative, very unusual
