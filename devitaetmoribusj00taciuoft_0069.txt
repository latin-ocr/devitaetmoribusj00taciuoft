THE ’11113511171111111151155 oF THE GERMANIA. lxiii

which the information obtainable niust have been scanty,
vague, and unreliable.¹ In these cases, he has at times
yielded to the temptation to which, as he himself tells us,
both Livy and Rusticus succumbed in their description of
Britain, who quae nondum comperta eloquentia percoluere
(ΑΨ. ch. 10, 4) Τ119 tendency, moreover, to forinulate a
well-balanced antithesis and to close a chapter with a neatly
turned epigram has occasionally resulted 111 slight incon-
gruities or unwarranted inferences.

But though the concrete material accumulated 111 the Ger-
ommia must 119 pronounced eniinently trnstworthy and
valuable, the same fidelity to ascertainable truth cannot be
claimed for the numerous reflectimus, motires. ⁸s'ocle'ngys, or
&leals which Tacitus attributes to the Germans. They are
almost without exception fancifnl² and, in at least one
instance, 3 bordei· on the grotesque. But these iniaginative
passages are due, partly to the romantio halo with which
Tacitus, as pointed out above, invested the barbarian races
of the north, partly to his sincere admiration of praise-
worthy qualities which they actually possessed, but which
119 failed to find in the civilized society of his time. The
very stylistic dress in which these reflections are generally
presented also marks them off clearly from the strictly
historica] information, and hence, so far from deceiving the
reader, these poetica] features im part to an otherwise purely
scientific treatise on ethnology and geography that irresist-
ible fascination which the (ἔω-1111111111 shares with every
consummate work of art.

1 These passages are especially noteworthy, as showing how careful
the author was to give only what he had reason to believe to be genu-
ine and trustworthy‚ this design being in striking contrast with the
nai've credulity and the lack of discrimination displayed, eg, by Mela,
Pliny, and others.
