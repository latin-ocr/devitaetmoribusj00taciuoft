Pion 53] NOTES. CHAPTER 40. 267

2. Νέτῐὶιιιω; probably the sister 01 1116 Norse god 01 fertility,
ij‘rdr, though her name does not occur in extant sources, that 01 1116
male deity being also very rare. They were the parents 01 Freyr and
Freya (see note ch. 9, 28), who seem to have displaced them in the
Norse mythology. The Phrygian massua mater Idaea, also called
Terra mmor (cp. Lucret. ΙΙ. 657), came to be identified by the ἰη-
terpretatio Romana with this northern goddess, owing to certain
ritualistic features which their worship shared in common, such as the
triumphal processipn 01 1116 deity in a chariot drawn by sacred cows,
the ablution 01 1116 divine symbol, and the wagon corresponding to
1116 Roman lavatio 01 1116 goddess and her car 3 see below, l. 14. This
ceremony took place annually, on March 27, and its Germanic counter-
part, representing the combined cult 01 1116 Ingaevonic peoples (see
note 611. 2, 7), was in all likelihood also a spring festival. The
solemnity 01 11115 ancient rite is admirably reflected in the rhetorical
elaboration of the passage, marked especially by anaphora and
asyndeton.

4. invehi with dative is post-Augustan usage. here probably due
to a desire 101· symmetry with intervenire rebus. Cp. note ch. 16,
30. populis: 1.6, as represented by the leyatt'ones mentioned above.
insula: the island cannot be identified. Most scholars suppose Alsen
in the Baltic Sea to be meant, but Miillenhoff advocates the site 01
Hamburg, which was originally an island.

5. castum: Izallowecl, a poetic epithet 01 a grove or forest as yet
untouched by the axe or not put to any profane uses. Cp. Hor.
Carm. I. 12, 59, and esp. Lucan, III. 399 ff.

6. veste: doubtless 01 white color. Cp. 611. 10, 9. adtingere,
etc.: 1.6, at the initiatory ceremony, for subsequently the slaves must
also have touched the car.

7. penetrali: the z'mnosc shrine, the 1101165101 1116 holy, here rep-
resented more particularly by the chariot. vectamque: aoristic.
Cp. note ch. 39, 15, and Catuli. CL, 1, multa per aequora vectus ‚· Verg.
Aen. VI. 3:35. bubus feminis: a Roman rit-ualistic expression sor
vaccis. The use 01 cattle proves such ceremonies 10 have been 01
hoary antiquity. Cp. Herod. I. 31, in the story 01 Cleobis and Biton.
οἱ δέ σφι βόες . . . οὐ παρεγίνοντο; Verg. G'eorgs. III. 532 1., quaesitas
ad sacra boves . . . ductos currus, 01 1116 Argive Juno. The same
practice survived in public processions among the Merovingian kingS,
in the 6th century.
