xlii INTRODUCTION. 1.

Briefly stated, their contention is this: The Germania is
a politz'cal pamphlet, written as a kind of rade mecum for the
emperor Trajan and in opposition to a powersul jingo party
in Rome which, it is alleged, clamored for a progressive
policy and vigorous offensive measures against the Germans.
Trajan, who had now for two years been occupied with re-
storing order and discipline among the Rhenish legions, and
had been actively engaged in fortifying the 110111101- line

cession to the throne sometime in 98 A.D., but he did not
return to the city till 99 ΑΛ). All eyes were turned to the
north, all Rome was on the (sni vive, 50 we are told, as to the
ultimate outcome of the emperor⁷s activity. This condition
of suspense naturally awakened renewed interest in the
history, origin, customs, prowess, etc„ of Rome's inveterate
but still unconquered foes. The appearance in 98 Ἀ.1). of
the Germania of Tacitus was, therefore, singular-ly well-

proved an effective weapon in the hands of the supporters
of Trajan's alleged defensive policy.

In this entire argumentation, everything is pure assump-

craved for enlightenment and instruction as to the character,
customs, and location of Germanic tribes, especially as they

lIt 15 interesting to observe how 1110 advocates of this theory never
fail to speak of the scatesman Tacitus, although he was at the time
known to fame only as an orator, nor have wc any evidence that
would have entitled him to that ‹lesignation at any other period in his
career.
