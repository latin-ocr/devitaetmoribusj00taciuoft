but their inforination, as in the case of the mercatores questioned by
Caesar, was of a very unsatisfactory description. —- On the collocation
of an abstract and concrete noun, see Introd. p. xxxiv.

13. in occasionem: i.e. he was retained as a useful informant
for a conteinplated second expedition. ex eo: sc. Ayrz'colcz, not
reyulo, for Tacitus could not have met this Irish chieftain. —This,
ch. 4, 15, and ch. 44, 30 are the only passages in this treatise in which
Agricola is directly cited as one of Tacitus's sources of. information.

14. legione una et modicis auxiliis: the chiasmus emphasizes
una and modicis, and thus gives additional force to Agricola's sanguine
conviction in the matter. debellari: a poetic word, occurring first
in Vergil.

15. adversus . . . profuturum: wouldredounslto the αᾱυαηιαῃε
of. The preposition expresses merely relation towards, the hostile or
frIendly sense being given by the context (profecturum), a usage
more common in Tacitus than in previous writers.

16. arma: sc. essent. On the ellipsis of the subjunctive of esse,
especially when another subjunctive is added, see Introd. p. xxxii.

22. primum adsumpta in partem virium: i.e. Agricola now
for the first time used this fleet as an integral part of his forces.
primum must not be too closely pressed, for. if we take it in the
sense of tunc primum, the statement would be at variance with ch. 24,
223 if understood to mean that he was the first Roman governor of
Britain to do so, the assertion is also questionable. For a similarly
loose use of primus, cp. Lucret. V. 336 f. 3 Hor. Cccrm. III. 30, 13;
Epist. Ι. 6, 48. ψ

Observe how in the following paragraph (ll. 23-31) the style at
once assumes a rhetorical coloring in passing from plain narrative to
vivid description, here seen iu the use of anaphora (ll. 23. 25 f. 27),
libration of clauses (ll. 26 f.), poetic or peculim· phrases (ll. 23. 25. 26.
28. 31), and oxymoron (ll. 30 f.).

23. egregia specie: sc. res. Ablative of quality with the usual
ellipsis. simul . . . simul : a Vergilian correlation, found in Livy
and often iu Tacitus. bellum impelleretur: the verb belongs
