present happy age, and he prophetically foretold the accession 01
Trajan to the throne. Trajan's aehievements in Germany before
91 A.D.‚ the year of his consulship, had drawn attention to 111111, as in
the similar case of Vespasian (ch. 13, ‘28 ff.) and his future greatness
seems to have been generally predicted. Cp. Plin. Panegs. 5, 943 Dio
Cass. LXVII. 12, 1. The involved structure of the sentence was due
to the author's sti-iving after conciseness.

7. apud nostras auris: in my presence. An instance of synec-
doche. This particular qnasi-personification occurs in four other
Tacitean passages. viZ. Hist. I. 263 Ann. I. 31; II. 393 IV. 29, but
apparently not elsewhere. ominabatur z nussim-abatur et valde
optabat. An instance of the so-called constructio praefluens. Cp.
Introd. p. xxxiii. festinatae mortis: objective genitive. The
passive meaning is first found in Sallust, e.g. [uss. 64, 6; with the
implication of prematurely inflicted death, eg. Juv. IV. 95 f., mors
. . ..festinata

8. evasisse: sc, eum, is the subject of solacium tulit, sc. nobis, as
contrasted with sicut ei (l. 5).

9. spiramenta : 111 this figurative sense the word occurs only here
and in Tacitus's imitator, Amin. Marcell. XXIX. 1, 40, who substitutes
mora for intervalla ,· XIV. 7. 15.

10. continuo et velut uno ictu: i.e. blows dealt out so un-
ceasingly as to amount to but a single stroke. continuo is not used
as an adverb by Tacitus, but may be conveniently translated as such
here.

11. exhausit z peijsocli't,· merely a strengthened form of haurire
which is very often used in this sense. Cp. eg. Claud. Quadrig. apud
Gell. N. A. IX. 13, 17; Lucret. V. 1322; Liv. VII. 10, 10, 1111111171ωό-

in the simple and compound verb, would unnecessarily introduce a
mixed metaphor.

Chapter 45. 12. Non vidit, etc. : such passages are typical of
rhetorical consolationes, a species of composition much cultivated in
ancient literature. Cp. Cic. <ze orat. III. 2, 8, non vidit (sc. Crassus)
flayrantem bello Italiam . . . non sceleris nefarii principes civitatis
reos . . . 11011 erilium gseneri, 11011 . . . C. Mari· sustam . . . non
