24. regia utilitas -- regyz'bus utilitati, a ἅπαξ εἰρημένον, although the
nominative alone for the dative is frequent. Cp. note ch. 13, 7.

Chapter 45. 25. pigrum ac prope inmotum ι ep. note Ayr. 10,
20, mare pigrum, the alind mare being here used because Oceanus in
the preceding chapter (11. 9. 12. 22) designated the Baltic.

26. cludjque terrarum orbem ι cp. Ayr. 33, 2:⁷3 of northern Cale-
donia ε in Ipso terraram ac naczwae fine. hinc fides ε z's proced by

27. cadentis for occidenti& is poetic. Cp. Verg. Aen. IV. 480,
Oceam'finem iuxta solemque cadentem ,· Hor. Carm. ΙΙΙ. 1, 27 ; Manil.
IV. 791. Only the summer solstice is here, as in Ayr. 12, 28 ff, taken
into account, for the midnight sun probably no Roman eye had ever
seen.

the solar fire in the ocean. It 15 first referred to by Epicurus,

2. formasque equorum : Tacitus' authorities may here have been
misled by the Graeco-Roman conception of the char-iot horses of Helios 3
at least there 15 nothing to correspond 10, it in Germanic mythology,
and Tacitus himself is sceptical as to the truth of the statement. See
below. radios capitis: i.e. the corona radiata of Helios. The
supposition that some vague information about the aurora borealis gave
rise to the notion is untenable, for the author is speaking of sunrise.
persuasio: superstition, popular belief. 'she word is often used in a
similar sense by Tacitus, in contrast to fides, and fama cera, e.g. Dz'al.
