278 Nores. CHAPTER 45. [111οΕ 56

omnia Oceanus post Oceanum nihil. 'Tacitus held to the disk-shaped
form of the earth ; cp. notes Ayr. 12, 32. 1. The confident assertion,
et sama ret-a, may possibly be due to the information furnished by
Agricola's circumnavigation of Britain.

4. Ergo z 1.0. since the world is here at 011 end, Ι now turn to the
east of the Baltic. Suebici maris : this (105181101100 for the Baltio
occurs only here. Cp. note 011. 43, 19, Suebia. Aestiorum gentes:
they belonged to the Balto-Slavic group and are the 0110051015 of the
old Prussians, Lithuanians, and Letts. Their 1011811080, which to the
untrained ear of traders (for it is to them that Taeitus⁷ information is
ultimately to be traced back) sounded like Celtic, would be alone suffi-
01001 10 stamp the Aestii as non-Germanic ; but the fact that language
is one of the principa] criteria of 0111111001 differentiation is a com-
paratively modern discovery, and Tacitus' error is, therefore, quite
excusable.

5. lingua Britannicae propior: the British islands were con-
eeived as 11111011 1100101· to 111050 regions 111011 they are, and hence the
1108015110 relationship of some other Celtic 10118110 with that of the
Aestii the more readily suggested itself to unscientifie observers who
had heard both spoken.

6. Matrem deum : i.e. m. (lem-um, 05 111 Anu. IV. 64, apud aedem
Macris deam. ln all probability here the 501110 as the Terra mater, or
Mamm illam· Idaea, mentioned ch. 40, 3, where 500 note. These cults
were clearly distinguished by the 1101110110, but the wearing of animal
symbols by the devotees of the Mamm Macer and the similar practice
110101101110081110 Aestii were sufficient for the {memo-etacio Romana
10 identify the two deities.

7. formas aprorum gestant : the boar was 0 Germanic symbol of
courage. Cp. Beowulf 304, —

The boar's likeness shown:
Over the visor, with gold adorned,
Bright and firehardened‚ the boar kept guard.

8. omnium: 1100101. Cp. note eh. 39, 21.

9. Rarus . . . usus: this would be in keeping with the peace-
10171118 dispositum of the Aestii, attested, 05 1010 05 1110 6111 century, by
Cassiodorus, I'ar. V. 2, pacatum hominum yemis 01110ιή0.

10. Frumenta ceterosque fructus: cereals ancl other fruics os
chefield. patientius : more enm-yetz'‹·allgs. pro solita Germa-
norum inertia : ep. eh. 14, 24 3 15, (ἲς 22, 27, and esp. 26, 18 ff.
