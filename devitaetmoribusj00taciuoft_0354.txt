25. non concupiscentibus: as men who would not be eager to
seize upon them raptu ec latrocinio, like other German tribes.

26. In Hermunduris Albis oritur: as the actual source of the
Elbe is in Bohemia, the authorities of Tacitus probably mistook the
δ’(ιαῖρ, 0116 of its tributaries, for the main stream. The Elbe was
discovered by the elder Drusus 111 0 1³.c., was crossed by L. Daumius
Ahenobarbus a few years later, and in ἴ) Aa». Tiberius entered its
mouth. Thereafter no Roman seems to have come within sight of the

of the few names of Germanic tribes whose etymology is reasonably
certain. They first appear in the army of Ariovistus (Caes. B. (τ’. Ι.

Maroboduus, in combination with other Suebic tribes, founded a
great confederacy, which proved very formidable to the Romans,
ln the 2d century, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, they invaded
Roman tei·1·it‹n·y, thus inaugurating the movement which finally led to
the downfall of the Western Empire. Their namc disappears after the
4111 century.

2. Quadi z see map. They are generally mentioned together with
the Marcomani. agunt : dwell, as in ch. 43, 20. Praecipua : sc.
esc. In Tacitus this adjective all but invariably precedes its noun
even when used as a predicate adjective. Here it agrees with the
nearer substantive. vires: military resource& Maroboduus is
