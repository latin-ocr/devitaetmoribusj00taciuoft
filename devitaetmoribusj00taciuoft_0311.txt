restricted sense of the game of (lice, though generally used in Latin of
any garne of chance. During the Republic, it was repeatedly prohibited
by special enactments, a law of Sulla being probably the earliest, tor
the lex alearia mentioned in Plaut. Mil. Glor. ΙΙ. 2, 9 (vs. 164) seems
to refer rather to the rules of the ganie. During the Empire gambling
fionrished to an extraordinary degree, many emperors being passion-
ately addicted to it. All gaming was finally forbidden by'Justinian.
The contrast here emphasized is, therefore, that the Gerinans, unlike
the Romans (cp. Suet. Oetae. 71. Domit. 21), played dice inter seria,
even when sobrii, and that they went so far as to give up their liberty
in payment of a ganibling ‹lebt. inter seria z nc serium. So very
frequently. Cp. eg. ch. 30, 13 Hz'sc. lv. «51, inter (Iona (z ut unum
ex donis); Ann. XIII. 23, inter indices (z ut iudex).

25. tanta . . . temeritate: with such foolhrcrdgs imlfiffhrence,
whether they teon (ιν lost. The idea expressed by ludendi is resolved
into its two component parts for the purpose ot securing for the
following statement a more definite antecedent, viz. perdendi temeritas.

26. defecerunt: i.e. when they had staked all their possessions
extremo ac novissimo iactu: tlte last (md decis-ive thr-ow. The
phrase is only apparently tautological, eat-tremo expressing the last
chance absolutely, noviss-{mo the last that presented itself on this occa-
sion. Cp. Cic. <Ze (liv. II. 43. 91; Caes. B. (ῤ’. Ι. 5, 3, extremum «tque
ultimum. de libertate ac de corpore contendant: they scalt-(2
cheir freedom. that is to say, their very person, the second phrase being
added epexegetically in order to define (le libertate inore closely. The
usual interpretation, cle libertate corpori-⁸³, is rendered impossible by
the repetition of the preposition.

27. Victus: thf» laser. Observe the alliterative collocation of v
and p (below). voluntariam: for. as in modern communities,
gambling debts could not be legally exacted.

28. iuvenior sc. victore. This post-Augustan comparative (eg.
Sen. Rhet. Contr. VII. praef. 43 X. 2. 313 Sen. Epist. 26, 7; Plin.
N. H. X. 29, 43, 83, thereafter frequent) was probably here used for
iunior, to prevent robustior froin being taken in its usual sense of
adult, mature. Quamvis: with acomparative. occurs in Tacitus again
Αηη. ΙΙΙ. 52, quamvis qravz'ora. Translate: be he never so younq,
never so strongy. adligari z Zz'qari. Prepositional compounds with
the meaning of the simple verb are especially characteristic of post—
Augustan Latin. Cp. Plut. Quaesc. Rom. 26, τὸ δὲ δῆσαι Λατῖνοι ποί-
λαι μὲν λιγᾶρε, νῦν δὲ ἀλλιγᾶρε καλοῦσιν; Seu. Epist. 58, 3. cernere . . .
