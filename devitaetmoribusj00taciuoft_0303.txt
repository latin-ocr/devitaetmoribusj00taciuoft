i.e. in spite of these intimate ties between uncle ancl nepheW, the in—
heritance passed in the direct line of consanguinity. Hence, avunculi

follows patrui (uncle on the father's side).

6. liberi: sons, as in ch. 18, 4, for daughters and women gener-
ally were rigidly excluded from inheriting immovahle property down
to very much later times. et nullum testamentum: again in
striking contrast with Rome. The entire history of Teutonic juris-
prudence confirms this statement, written testation not being gener-
ally met with till the llth century. Engl. heir (= heres) and the
German Erbe (orbus, ὄρφανος) are also of foreign origin.

¹7. proximus gradus, etc.: the Romans, as early as the laws of the
Twelve Tables (5th century ss.c.), distinguished between the tesca-
mentm-ia and the iusta or Ieyilima hereditas. It is only the latter
that was known to the Gerinans and most primitive peoples. in
possessione sc. sunt. i.e. talce possession, nomem, etc. The noun
is from possiclo, not possideo, as in Asson 18, 43 Anii. II. 15, and else-

where, eg. Cic. pro Quincc. 26, 833 Liv. XXXIII. 41, 3.

8. propinquorum . . . adfinium: relatives by blood aad bymar-
riaye.

9. gratiosior: che more honored. orbitatis pretia: Roman

literature teems with references to this notorious practice of legacy-

22, nec credipotest qna obsequiorum diversitate coluntur homines sine
liberis Romae, Tacitus furnishing, perhaps. the most numerous pas-
sages, Cp. note Dial. 6. 7.

Chapter 21. Not only is property inherited in the direct line, but
also feuds and friendships, the latter in turn leading naturally to the
German's hospitable treatment of strangers.

10. inimicitias: feucis, the German Felecle. The Latin word in
this more or less technical meaning is rare. Cp. note Dial. 36, 43
Lucret. V. 1146. Blood vengeance, venciensi. is characteristic of all
primitive society. Cp. also Beowulf. 2435 ff.

11. necesse est: is (ι (iictzj,i111pose(l by immemorial custom.
neo z nec tamen. So eg. in Sall. Jny. 20, 6, and very frequently in
Tacitus. implacabiles sc. inimiciciae. agreeing with only a part
of the antecedent, on which usage, cp. note ch. 2, 3.

12. luitur: this compensation, known as Weryelcl, the Hotneric
ποινή, our (lanzagses, was regulated in proportion to the extent of the
injury. the rank of the assaulted party being also taken into consider-
