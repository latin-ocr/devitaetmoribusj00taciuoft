the preposition. Cp. Introd. p. lxvii.

11. ceteros: i.e. Germanos qui non remittatur. We should ex-
pect ceteras, sc. flentes, and perhaps Tacitus wrote thus. impares
libertini : the infiriorz'ty of tlte freemen. The adjective impares is
used for the abstract noun (which does not exist in Latin) and a
genitiVe. This construction, though especially frequent in Tacitus, is
used by him preferably with participles and pronoininal adjectives.
The original distinction between libertus, the freedlnan in relation to
the niamunitter, and libertinus. 111 1113 relation to his social 01 politica]
status, is no longer rigidly observed in post-Augustan Latin, and would
111 any case be inapplicable to Germanic conditions. With the state—
ment itself, cp. Ann. XIV. 39.

Cp. Ann. VI. 10, quw-unias faenore aza-timum. The statement is
somewhat inconsistent with ch. 5. 23 ff„ which seems to pret-lude the
possibility of systelnatic money transactions. Cp. what is said even
of the savage Penni 111 eh. 443, 21.

14. magis servatur, etc.: i.e. this ignorance of usury is better
maintained than if its practice had been forbidden. The German-s.
being unacquainted with faenus (caelare, etc, were thus not even
tempted to introduce it. The usual interpretation of this, in any case
strained, epigram, which supplies 'ritanus non (zgsz'care, etc., as subject
of seri-atur and the positive again with vetitum esset, involves an
exceedingly harsh ellipsis, unparalleled even in Tacitus. He frequently
allows the positive idea to be supplied out of a previous negative ex-
pression, but never the reverse. Cp. note Dz'al. 34, 10. vetitum
esset: as was frequently done in Rome, eg. by the lew Gennez‘a, in
342 B.C. For a detailed account of the legislation 111 regard to the
legal rates of interest, see Ana. VI. 16. For a somewhat similar
epigrannnatic antithesis, cp. Justin. ΙΙ. 2 (cited note ch. 46, 23).

author, a corruption in the MSS. (in vices), and certain discrepancies
