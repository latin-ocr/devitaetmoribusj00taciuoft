Chapter 31. 7. voluit z ‹lem-evit. So often; With natm-a per-
sonified, eg. Val. Max. VII. 1, 1; Quint. X. 3, 4. alibi: some-
where Or other, not elsewhere, for Calgacus cannot have meant to
exclude the British auxiliaries in Britain itself. See note on aliquis
(cll. 38, 19). British cohorts are found eg. in the armies of Caecina
and Vitellius, at the second battle of Bedriacum, in Pannonia, and
elsewhere, as we learn from Tacitus's Hz'storz'es aud inscriptions.

8. hostilem z hostium. Tacitus often substitutes this and other
adJ'ectives 1011116 genitive. subjective as here, eg. Αηη. XIII. munitate
hostiles ,· Hz‘st. III. 77, elamore hostili. Cp. also note Dial. 29, 21.

9. nomine amicorum atque hospitum: tlu- thought is slightly
obscured by overconciseness. the implication {ming that the victims
were by the false professions of friendship and lmspitality first thrown
off their guard and then ‹lishonored

10. ager atque annus z their yearly harvest ‚· annus alone in this
sense occurs first in Cic. Γῆν. Ι. 1, 14. 40. In prose again Germ.
14, 1, but often in post-Aufrustan epic poetry, eg. Lucan. III. 70;
· Stat. Theb. IX. 406. Assar is here added for the sake of balancing
the five other groups of virtually synonymous expressions in this one
sentence. in frumentum, eto: with the sentiment, an oratorical
commonplaee, cp. ch. 19, 2 fil, and the speech of Boudicca in Dio
Cass. LXII. 3.

11. emuniendis: ῐη the vlearz'nq. atque . . . ac . . . ac .
ac: such acc-uinulati‹5›ns of ac are extremely rare in Latin. Cp. note
Dial. 17, 28.

12. inter verbera ac contumelias: contumelia has here the
concrete and restricted meaning of euffs ῖιι the face, alapae, as distin-
guished fron] the gencric term verbera, Mows. Cp. Hist. III. 31,
praeberi OS c‹mtzamelz'i.si,· 85, erz'gsere os defferre contumelz‘e's. On the
combination, see Introd. p. xxx.— inter, i.e. alternating between. So
similarly, ch. 32, 19 ; Hz'sc. I. 1, inter infensos vel obnowz'os. con-
teruntur: used ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, figuratively With bona formataeque and
(asser atque (anneis, in its usual sense with corpora . . . manus. Cp.
Introd. p. xxxii. It is, therefore, not necessary to supply consumun-
tm· by zeugma. nata servituti: so e. g. Cic. (Ze prov. cons. 5, 10 for
1116 regular nasei ad.

13. semel veneunt, etc.: cp. the words put into the mouth of
Boudicca by Dio Cass. l.c., πόσῳ κρεῖττον ἦν ἅπαξ τισὶ πεπρᾶσθαι
μᾶλλον ἢ μετὰ κενῶν ἐλευθερίας ὀνομάτων κατ’ ’ἔτος λυτροῦσθαι, evidently
