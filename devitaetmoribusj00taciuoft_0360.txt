16. solutum z i.e. the oars were not fixed in oar-looks, but could
be shifted as occasion demanded. quibusdam fluminum z q. flu-
minibus. So eg. Da'al. 21. 15. q. aiztz'quornm,· ΛΨ. 37, 29, hostium
. . . qu'z'dmn, and very frequently in the larger works. Cp. also note
ch. 43, 4.

17. hinc vel illinc remigium: they νοω now οη this, now on that
side.

11011151111011011 10 the indifference attributed to the Germans generally,
in 011. 5, 22. eoque unus imperitat z some such theory of the origin
of monarchical institutions seems to be iniplied in Lucret. V. 1114 ff,
quod (50. divitiae> facile ec validis et pulchris dempsit honorem ,· Divi-
tioris enim sectam plerumque secuntur eramlubet etsorces et pulchro
corpore creti. nullis iam exceptionibus ε no Ionam-with any re-
strictions, 511011 as limited the sovereign or princeps in 011101 German
connnunities. Cp. ch. 7. 30; 11, 13 ff.. and above, l. 8.

19. non precario iure parendi: with α rigyhc to exstet obedience
not based οη suffcrance, the genitive of the substantival gerund being
equivalent to a Greek articul-ar infinitive (τοῦ πείθεσθαι). Precarz’us is
often used of something contingent and transitory, as opposed 10 what
is inalienable and permanent. Cp. Hisc. Ι. 52, precarium sem· impe-
rium et brevi transitu rum. The witnesses upon which Tacitus'
account is ultimately based probably became acquainted with the
Suiones at their 01 eat religious festiv al, 11 111011 occurred* ev ery nine years,

20. in promiscuo : in everybody's hands. clausa: i.e. during
the peace which prevailed at religious festivals. Cp. ch. 40, 10 f.
Tacitus‘ sources probably inistook this fact for the regular custom‚
and he was thence misled into thinking that it was a despot's device
to prevent revolution.

21. et quidem servo : and α slave αι τὴαι. Τ1115 15 explained by
enimvero, etc, below, the intervening quia clause giving two reasons
for arma . . . clausa, the first accounting for the needlessness of arins,
the second for their unclesirabilicy.

22. manus: hands, as in 011. 37, 2. facile lasciviunt: and
are hence rendered incapable of effectual opposition. On the enervatf
ing effect of peace, see note 011. 14, 24.

23. neque . . . neque . . . ne . . . quidem: this polysyndeton
is especially 0011111101] 111 Tacitus, and 111 a descending climax, as here.
