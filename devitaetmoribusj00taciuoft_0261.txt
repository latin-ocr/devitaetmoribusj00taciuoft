PAGE 35] No'rns. CHAPTER 6. 177

Trajan and Antonine columns. llelmets have but rarely been found
in German graves. forma: hmuly. The fact. here stated is fre-
quently attested, eg. by Caes. B. G. [V. 2. 2. But, by the 5111
century, if not earlier, this was no lmiger true, the Germans paying
considerable attention to the breeding of horses. 'l‘he name ot' the
city of Stuttqart still bears testimony to this oecupation.

14. Sed: one might overlook these drawbacks it' they were only
properly trained like Roman hot-ses, bnt they are found wanting even
in this. nec z ne . . . quidem, eg. Dlal. 21. 22. variare gyros:
a Tacitean coinage for the regular ναι-1113 agyras flvvtere, i.e. they
describe a movement resembling the figure 8. Cp. Verg. (r'enrgs. 111.
1903 Aen. V. 85. 5843 Ovid. Met. VI. 226. This criticism was in all
probability not applicable to the 'sent-teri (ch. 32, :30 f.) or 1110. Batavi
(Cass. Dio LV. 24; l'lut. Otho 12), who were renowned for their
horsemanship.

15. in rectum: sti-mylae alavart dextros: here noted, because
both Greeks and Romans were accnstomed t‹› turn to the left, ns in
the arena. The observation of Tar-itus. 01 rather ot' his authority, is
in a measure confirmed by the circumstance that we frequently find
but one stirrup in Germanic graves. Cp. in general the interesting
discussion in Xenoph. Περὶ ἴππ. 7, 11 ff. agunt: sc. equites. On
the change of subject, cp. note 011. 3, 19.

16. coniuncto orbe, 010. : the riders formed a radius of a circle,
and, as they wheeled about 1110, 0011110, they kept a perfectly straight
line, 110 0110 lagging behind his neighbor. In universum aesti-
manti: on this dative 01 1110 person judging, see note, Agsr. 11, 9,
where the identical phrase occurs.

17. plus penes peditem roboris: this is noted in particular 01
1110 Chatti (ch. 30, 4) and the Britan& (Astr- 12, 20). eoque z
ideoque, and therefore. So frequently in Tacitus and elsewhere.
mixti: sc. cum equitibus. proeliantur: sc⁴ pedites, 10 be supplied
from the collective singular preceding.

18. velocitate: assility. Cp. [Caes] B. G. VIII. 36, 2, pedites,
summae velocitatis* lwmae'nes. On this method ot fighting, see Caes.
B. (4.1. 48, 5 ff.; Amin. Marc. XVI. 12, 21 f. (the battle of strass-
burg, 357 A.D.). Thereafter we hear no more of it, 1101 even in poetry.
Its abandonment was probably due to the great increase in cavalry
among the Germans, which rendered them independent of support
from the infantry. The same custom is, however, also attributed to
the Boeotians, the Bastarnae, and the Gauls.
