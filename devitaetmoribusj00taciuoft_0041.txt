IV. POETICAL AND FIGURATIVE FEATURES.

As already remarked, the two authors who exerted the
greatest influenee upon the style and voeabulary of Tacitus
are Vergyil and Sallust; but, indisputable as this is, we must
guard against the temptation of regarding all striking par-
allelisins as so many direct reininisoenees. Many Vergilian
phrases, and the same is true of Sallust, had, by the time
Tacitus eomposed the sim-scol«, become common 1⁷›roperty
In fac-t, if the prose of the post-Augustali age be distin-
guished froin the Ciceronian period by one feature more
than another, it is its 111-01011111] indebtedness to the language
of the poets,¹ Livy, whose phraseology is also under heavy
obligations to Vergil, standing at the threshold of this
movement. In the following some of the inore noteworthy
of the stylistic parallelisins between Tacitus and earlier
writers, pointed out 111 the Notes, are briefly summarized:
