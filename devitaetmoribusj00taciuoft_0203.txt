common in Tacitus. Cp. eg. Dz'rtl. 8, 13 ff, ceteros quidem amit-os

. Marcellum autem ec Crispum ,· Hz'st. III. 32; Ann. III. 49.

18. ultra: i.e. beyond the Roman army, when once defeated.
formidinis: cause qffear. Cp. eg. ch. 36, 12; 41. 13; Prop. III.
(IV.) 13, 38; Lucan, VII. 72, modern languages being often more
precise and analytic than the Latin. vacua castella: abandoned
forts. Probably rhetorical plurals, like coloniae below, the statement
being an intentional exaggeration.

19. inter. etc.: What with reluctant oberlience on the one hand.
(cml wzjzcst authority οη the other, tlte towns (cre, etc. Cp. note ch.
31, 12. parentes . . . imperantes z obsequium . . . Imperium.
(m this usage see note 011. 4, 11.

20. aegra: 1·ζί at ease. An exceedingly common metaphor, both
in Greek and Latin. 111 reference to towns, eg. Soph. rint. 1015:
Claud. Bell. Get. 4:37. —The two adjectives are used predicatively, on
which usage see Introd. p. XXV. municipia: l'ernlcmziam, and,
possibly, Londinium, though the plural ma)v be merely rhetorical.
On the position between the two attributes. see Introd. p. xxvi.
Hic dux : viz. Calgacus himself.

21. metalla: this contradicts ch. 31, 18, unless we suppose that
foreign or British mines are here meant to be distinguished from Cale-
donian. et ceterae ι this phrase, usually after a polysyndetic enu-
meration, is characterIStic of Tacitean style.

22. in hoc campo : i.e. depends upon the battle to be fought 011
this field. The statement is common in speeches of this nature. Cp.
Ami. II. 15. alim? sihi rvlz'qnnm qnam tenere libertatem aut mori ante
servitiam.

24. maiores . . . cogitate: inore emphatic than the more usual
construction with de. Cp. Plin. Epist. II. 1. 12, I'ergsz'm'um cossito.

Chapter 33. The speech of Agricola (33, 30-34. ὅ) is pitted.
point for point, against that of Calgacus. Here, as there. the situ-
ation is represented as critical ; there is an appeal to the valor of the
soldiers, 1110 rewards of victory and the dire ccmsequences of a defeat
are dwelt upon in both. Finally a supreme confidence in the out-
come, based upon former achievements. and a depreciation of the
enemy. are expressed by both speakers. This perfect parallelism of
structure would be alone sufficient to stamp both speeches as works
of the imagination. The address ot' Agricola, however, unlike that
of Calgacus, ma)v have had some historical background (see note
