by the side of ιωζῑίνηιιιηῐ, would be tautological.

to Dc'al. 213, 6, The following indirect disse-‹mrse shows that Tacitus
here returns to his authorities, who, contrary to the traditional view,
cannot be the quidam: for, 111 the absence of all evidence to the con-
trary, there. is no reason to believe that there was any (liff‹·1·ence of
opinion mneerning the statement in this closing [mragrapli. Note
also that a qnidam, according to the mode of citation customary
among the an‹·ients. need not refer to more than one author. recens
et nuper auditum is opposed to ‹wliqim Ποιηῐιια. On the elastic
signification of nuper, see note Da'al. (Α, 18. llere it refers back to
Caesar⁷ a period of about 150 years, or possibly to the time of the
Slave War (73-71 11.(;.).

Subsequently the. victors assumed the very name which they had
devised for a specific purpose. The phlenomenon itselt' has numerous
analogies. Thus Graeci and Hellenes were originally small tribes
dwelling in Epirus and Thessaly. Cp. also the French Allemaml for
