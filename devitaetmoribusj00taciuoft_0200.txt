116 noras. CHAPTER 31. [Pion 20v

another rhetorical commonplace in speeches of this kind. ultro:
moreover, in tlte Ζὶανςχαίη. So often.

14. Britannia: on the ellipsis of sed, see Introd. p. xxxi. emit

. . pascit: refer respectively to tribucum and frumentum (l. 10).
Calgacus says with bitter sarcasm that the Britons are daily paying
for the privilege of being Roman slaves, instead of having their
masters, if servitude it must be, care for them.

15. sicut in familia: somewhat inconsistently with true por-
traiture of character, the speaker is made to allude to purely Roman
conditIOns, of which 116 could not have had any knowledge. But such
inaccuracies are frequent in the speeches of ancient historialis. In
Tacitus, eg. 011.15 , 32. 5; 30, 2; 32, 32; Hz'sc. I. 30. Observe also
that this simile makes Calgacus sorget the statements made in ch.
30, 15. 22 ff. ——sz'cuc . . . sic, for sicut (ut) . . . ῖῑα, also Hist. Ι.
84.—0n the brachylogical character of the simile, see snm-od. p.
xxxiii.

17. novi nos et viles: 1.6. while we cannot expect to escape the
usual treatment experienc by newly acquired slaves, we are, more-
over, held so worthless a lot, that our masters will not stop short of
extermination to get rid of us again.

19. exercendis z to enslasse upon. This clause gives the reasons
for viles. We are not a paying investment to the Romans, says the
speaker, for we have no arable land, no mines, no harbors, upon
which we can 116 put to work. In this sense, with inanimate objects‚
exercere is poetic and post-Augustam but comparatively rare. Cp.
Hcst. II. 82. porro: (sn the other hand what we do possess is
equally obnoxious to the Romans. though 011 other grounds (lonqin-
quz'tas, etc).

20. longinquitas . . . tutius: a restatement, in different form,
011-11 30, 21-25.

21. suspectius: the more (ῖαηςγρνοῑω. For this sense, cp. eg.
Liv. XXI. 7, 7. Their distance and seclusion made them more for-
midable, as the Romans had no means to determine the real strength
and the purposes of the Britons and—omne ¹z'qnocum pro massnifico
(ch. 30, 25).

22. sumite animum: muster up your couraqe. In this sense
first, and only once, in Livy, viz. VI. 23, 3.

23. Brigantes: Petilius won some moderate successes against
them, see note ch. 17, 8. They are not mentioned elsewhere in con-
nection with the uprising under Boudicca, but Calgacus is here made
