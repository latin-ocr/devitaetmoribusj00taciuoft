and in the description of Ariovistus' forces, which included a large
Suebic contingent, mention is made of both long and short swords.
Cp. Cass. Dio, XXXVIII. 49. et erga reges obsequium: on the
peculiarly Tacitean use of et after an asyndeton, see note ch. 30, 25.
Obsequium is a quasi-technical term for submission to established
authority. Cp. eg. Dz'al. 41, 12, in obsequium ressenti's paratos ‚· ΑΨ.
42, 25. Tacitus (or his authority) here betrays his relative ignorance
concerning the Germans of the East by his inability to point out more
detailed and significant distinctions from those in the West. In fact,
his narrative from here to the close becomes ever more vague and
obscure, or purely fabulous.

12. Suionum: the modern Swedes. Here, however, as civitates
shows, it must be taken in a wider sense, namely, of the entire popu-
lation of Scandinavia. hinc: α Ruyz'z's ec Lemoviz's, toward the
north or northwest. ipso in Oceano z either contrasted with ab
Oceano or else it may refer to the notion, entertained down to the
Middle Ages, that Scandinavia was an island. The former interpre-
tation is perhaps preferable. viros armaque z armed forces. This
hendiadys is frequent in Tacitus and elsewhere; but here it more
particularly means infantry, as opposed to classibus. It should be
observed that the grossly exaggerated accounts of the huge size and
population of Scandinavia, found eg. in Pomp. Mela, III. 6, 54, Plin.
N. H. IV. 13, 27, 96, and still reiterated for centuries later, are signifi-
cantly ignored by Tacitus.

13. differt: sc. α forma Romanarum navium.

14. utrimque prora: vessels in which the bow and stern were
built alike were also known to the Greeks by the name δίπρωροι, or
δίπρυμνοι. Similar ships, with steering gear at each end, were built by
Germanicus (Anu. ΙΙ. 6), by the Veneti (Caes. B. G. III. 13), and by
the barbarians on the Euxine, as described in Hist. III. 47. They
a-re in use to this day in Norway, being particularly serviceable in
narrow waterways‚ where a vessel could not be turned around.
adpulsui frontem agit : present the bonifor Iamle'ny.

15. velis ministrant : sc. naves ,· handle their vessels by means of
sails. The phrase is Vergilian, ministrare being used for administrare.
Cp. Aen. VI. 302, ipse ratem . . . velisque ministrat ‚· X. 2183Va1. Flacc.
Aryon. III. 38. The old Norse sagas confirm this statement, and the
vessels of the Augai, on their invasion of Britain, are also said to have
had no sails. in ordinem: ιο secure α reyular order. The final
use of in with the accusative is exceedingly common in Tacitus.
