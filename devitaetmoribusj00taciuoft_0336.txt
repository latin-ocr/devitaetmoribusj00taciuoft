252 NOTES. CHAPTER 34. [PAGE 49

positive. et z etiam. Romanis classibus : viz, those of Dru-
sus (12 1312), Tiberius (5 Διι.1).), and Germanicus (15-16 Α.ῐ).).
23. quin etiam : on the position, see note oh. 3, 29. Oceanum

illa temptavimus: from there we made erz'al os (ventured out upon)
the Oeean, i.e. for purposes of exploration. The verb is often used of
dangerous marine exploits, eg. Hor. (sarm. III. 4, 31; Seu. Nat.
Quaeso. VI. 23. 3, ipsam (sc. Oceanum) qaoque temptavit (se. Alexan-
der). On the personifieation of the Oeean, see below, 1. 27 3 ch. 2, 153
44, 22. Illa, sc. a parte z unde or ibi, a rare elliptical usage, e.g.
Plaut. Most. 111. 3, ⁶27 (vs. 931); Ovid, Fast. VI. 3953 and Tac.
Hz'st. III. 83 V. 18; Ana. II. 17. superesse: remained over, i.e.
unexplored. as shown by fama tietmar-it.

24. Herculis columnas : this statement is in all probability ulti-
mately due to Pytheas of Massilia (4111 century stc.) who. in his work
περὶ ὠκεανοῦ, told of his reaching what may be identified with the en-
trance to the Baltic Sea. which he mistook for the Tanais, flowing into
the Black Sea. where pillars of Hercules were also loeated by the an-
cients. The belief, moreover, of the presence of Hercules in Germany
(see ch. 3, 17), and the actual existence of certain lofty rocks in the
northern ocean, may easily have led Pytheas to this identification.
The supposition that some fanciecl resemblance to a name, like Hyye-
lac (Beowulf. 1820), was responsible for the statement is improbable,
as this designation could not have been known to the Romans, nor
had any one in recent times reached this region, as Tacitus expressly
says. fama vulgavit: accordz'nss to a wiaespread tradition. This
same phrase is particularly frequent in Curtius. Cp. esp. X. 3, 1, 17,
ibe· (i.e. Gades) namque columnas Herculis esse fama vicl-(faverat.
adiit: rwas actually there, the emphasis being given by the position
of the predicate.

25. in claritatem . . . referre consensimus: ic z's ayreecl to
put to the credit of hirs fame. With the sentiment, cp. Servius on
Verg. Aea. XI. 20¹2, qaod autem ait Protei colunum-13, ratione non
vacat, nam columnas Herculis lefstanus et in Ponto et in Hispania.
Hanc autem Proteum fortissimzmz . . . constcctsue'sse. Novimus au-
tem qaod omnosfortes Hercules dicebantur.

27. Druso Germanico: Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus the
Elder, the stepson of Augustus, brother of Tiberius, was the first
Roman to penetrate the North Sea, as is expressly attested by Suet.
Claud. 1, 11, and by implication in Augustus, Monam. Ancyr. Cp.
note ch. 1, 5. obstitit . . . inquiri: the infinitive after obsistere
