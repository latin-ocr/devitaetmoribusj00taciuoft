of the most illustrious advocates of the time, M. Aper and
Julius Secundus, whom he has ininiortalized in the treatise
referred to, being then about twenty years of age.

In 77 A.D., the already renowned orator was betrothed to
the daughter of Agricola, the marriage¹ taking place shortly
after, on the departure of his father—in-law for Britain.

About the same time began his official career. The pas-
sage 111 which Tacitus refers to this is tantalizingly brief
and indefinite,2 but it is probable that he first held the office
of a tribunus militum, serving also as 0116 of the viginti
riri, a lower magistracy, given to men possessing the census
senatorias, and usually the direct stepping-stone to the
quaestorship. To this office he seems to have been ap-
pointed by Titus, about 80 A.D., the legal age being twenty-
five. The dates of his tribuneship or aedileship are
unknown, but in 88 A.D. 116 was present as praetor and
quindecimvir sacris faciundis at the laeli saeculares.3 In
the following year Tacitus was absent from Rome, very
probably in the capacity of propraetor of some ininor
province, possibly Belgium.4 He did not return till after
the death of Agricola, in 93 A.D.⁵ The strained relations
between Domitian and Agricola doubtless retarded Tacitus's
further promotion, and he did not reach the consulship till
97 A.D., under Nerva. In 100 Ap. Tacitus and Pliny were
associated in the iinpeaclnnent of Marius Priscus, the pro-
consul 01 Africa. Some dozen or more years later he was

historian's father.
