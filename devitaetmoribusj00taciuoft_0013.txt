LIFE AND WRITINGS OF TACITUS. Vll

proconsul of Asia, as we learn from an inscription.¹ The
date of his death is altogether unknown, but it cannot have
been earlier than 116 A.D., as may be inferred from an allu-
sion to the conquests of Trajan?

WritingS. -If we except the youthful but brilliant Dia-
loqus and numerous speeches which the distinguished orator
doubtless published from time to time, according to the
prevailing custom, Tacitus’s illustrious career as a writer
begins with the Ayrz‘colcc, whieh appeared shortly after the
death of Nerva <J an. 27, 98 An), although the entire work
with the exception of the prooemium (1-3) and one passage
at the close,3 may well have been composed immediately
after the death of Domitian.

In the same year there followed the Germania, the date
being fixed by ch. 37, 5 ff. of that work.

The Histories, announced as in contemplation in the Ami--
cola (ch. 3, 28-30), appeared between 105-109. They com-
prised the story of the reigns of Galba, Otho, Vitellius,
Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, but only the first four
books and a fragment of the fifth. dealing with the year
69-70, have survived.

The Annals began with the death of Augustus, and con-
cluded with the assassination of Nero in 68 ΑΛ), Only
bks. I.-1V., portions of V. and VI„ and bks. XL-XVI, are
preserved, the entire narrative of‘ the reign of Caligula,
the beginning of that os: Claudius, and the end of Nero's
being lost.

2 Ann. II. 61 ; IV. 4.

3 Ch. 44, 4-11 has all the appearance of an afterthought, it being in
the nature of a vaticinium post eventum, and ch. 45, 112, non vidit,
etc„ it seemS, would very appropriately have followed immediately
after potest. . . effuyz'sse. The absence of the epithet divus in
ch. 3, 13 need not imply that Nerva was still living when these words
were penned. See note ad loc.
