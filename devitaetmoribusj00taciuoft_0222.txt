. . per ignaviam: on this characteristic variation, see [merod. p.

21. militares viri: a phrase of frequent occurrence in Tacitus,
designating nien of rank and military experience as opposed to the
common milites of the cohort. Here it lnay be rendered officers.

22. expugnati : of persons first in a single passage of Caesar, viz.
B. G. VII. 10, 1, then repeatedly in Livy, eg. XXII. 30, 2, and in later
prose. limite: the celebrated limes [armanus or frontier line of
defences, stretching from the Rhine near Crdogne to Ratisbon on the
Danube, a distance o 350 miles. Domitian had built and laid out a
considerable part of it.

23. et ripa: here and (v'erm. 28, 18, of the Danube, but elsewhere
in Tacitus, when used absolutely, it refers to the Rhine, the con-
text. preventing any ambiguity. — The ec is epexegetic, that is to say.
So Anii. I. 1, consilium mihi pauca (Ze Aussusto et extrema tradere.
possessione: sc. pror-z'ncimmm.

24. dubitatum: was ἱη qavstfon, ac stulte. With the phrase,
cp. Luci-et.. III. 83& with the thought, Cic. Aeaci. Pr. ΙΙ. 43, 132.
damna damnis continuarentur: when one disaster followed closely
upon the other. Cp. Liv. II. 54, 2, cmztz'nnacur paci externae conses-
tim discordis( ‹⁷100an XXXI. 41, 17 ; Lucret. III. 71.

25. omnis annus: year aflei· year. funeribus: (learns. In
this signification, the word is poetic and in Tacitus found only here,
though he repeatedly uses it in the equally poetic, but rare, sense of a

dead body, a meaning unsuitable to the present passage. posce-
batur . . . Agricola : observe the effective word—order and sonorous

rliytlnn, in keeping with the significance of the statement itself.

26. comparantibus cunctis: Tacitus, for euphonic reasons,
habitually avoids ommibus after forins in -Nms, using cimctz's or
'universis instead.

27. constantiam: intrepislz'tss, opposed to for'mz'c‘lo, as Tri-(sorem to
[nertio. expertum bellis animum: unless Tacitus wrote belli,
as in Vere. Ami. X. 173, belli inexpertos, IIe'st. IV. 76, militem . . .
mmm-tumque belli, it will be preferable to take bellis in the sense
of proeliis, so eg. Hist. IV. 58, sianum belli· Batai-us dabit, for
Agricola's military experience was confined to the war against the
Britons. On et after an asyndeton, see Intrnd. p. xxviii.

29. auris verberatas ε the ears were tor-mentm, a colloquial meta-
phor, found as early as Plautus, eamus-³71. 1. 1, 177. dum: while.
