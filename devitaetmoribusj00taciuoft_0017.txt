LITERARY CHARACTER OF THE AGRICOLA. xi

3. ἐπιτηδεύματα. 4. πράξεις. 5. σύγκρισις. 6. ἐπίλογος. Their
order is definitely fixed only 101 the first, the second, and
the last3 in the arrangement 01 1118 0111818 certain preferences
are expressed, but otherwise considerable latitude is allowed.
No rhetorically trained writer seems to have ventured to
emancipate himself from this traditional norm, except in
minor details; but in the handling 01 1118 subject matter,
an author was less hampered, his treatment being natu-
rally conditioned by countless considerations inherent in
the theme 118811, 111 1118 circumstances under which he
wrote, and in 1118 purpose he had in view.

Now a coinparison between these rhetorical precepts and
illustrations and the Agfficola reveals the fact that Tacitus,
as far as possible, followed similar models.

1. Prooemium (ch. 1-3). As already remarked7 no rigid
or precise rules 101 1118 introduction to the βασιλικὸς λόγος
or any other 01 1118 many encomia are laid down, but instead
a large number 01 suggestions is enumerated from which a
choice might be made. The prooemium 01 1118 Ayrz'coZa is
one 01 exquisite art and originality, 101 not only does it
impart considerable information 01 a strictly introductory
nature, but, at the same time, it succeeds in giving that
peculiar perspective in which Tacitus doubtless desired his
readers to view the story 01 11118 hero.

2. Γένεσις, φύσις, ἀνατροφή. These subjects are discussed
in ch. 4 1., 1118 resemblance to Menander’s illustrations being
particularly striking,l a fact which, 01 8011188, does not
invalidate the trustworthiness 01 1118 statements themselves.
It is, moreover⁷ not the identity 01 arrangement as such
