PREFACE
TO THE GERMANIA.

Tm: literature which has accumulated about this immortal
treatise is well-nigh overwhehning. my own bibliography, though
probably far from exhaustioe, filling about fourteen printed
pages. Under these circumstances there can be but little 100111
for originality, and the chief task of an editor of a book of this
nature will primarily consist 111 3 careful sifting and an exten-
sive condensation of the exegetica] material furnished by gen-
erations of German scholars; for, with the possible exception of
Fustel de Cofflanges, no others seem hitherto to have contributed
anything of real value to the elucidation of the Germania. But
in spite of this fact, there still 1-61113111 not a few passages which
have in my judgment been uniformly misinterpreted, scholars being
somewhat reluctant to recognize 311 (trs nesciendi, or prone to read
into the treatise of Tacitus what they strongly felt ought to be
there. In all these instances, as well as 111 many others in which
tradit-ional views seemed to me unwarranted, Ι have, even at the
risk of incnrring the charge of presumption, not h'esitated to give
my own 00110111510115, although the scope and aim of this edition
precluded their detailed justification.

It is, of course, quite impossible to enumerate all the scholars
to whom Ι 3111 under obligations, and I 0311, therefore, in this
place mention only those works to which Ι am specially indebted
throughout. Of more recent commentaffles, Ι have always had
before me those of Baumstark, Muellenhoff (Deutsche Allertlz¹7
Vol. IV.)‚ Schweizer-Sidler, Ζ61·11131 2, E. Wolff, and F urneaux. Ι
have also constantly consulted the ενοι-115 of Zeuss, Grimm, waitz,
