take it all the more to heart, if their women are captured. Nomine, a
phrase seemingly taken from commercial life occurs repeatedly in
Tacitus and elsewhere. Silarum is superfluous, but here adds a touch
of affection. Cp. also ch. 13, 103 30, 24. Translate: They have (m

19. animi : peaceuhle disposition, the levares, the civicas being con-
ceived rather as an aggregate of individuals than a political organiza-
tion. Similar quasi-personifications are frequent, e.g. AsJr. 19, 223

20. puellae quoque nobiles: the stress, as shown by quoque, is
011 puellae. The emphatic position of the adjective was, however,
necessary to avoid the collocation inter obsides nobiles. puellae qnoque,
which could only mean that the affection in which the Germans held
their women rendered noble birth a less essential qualification than in
the case of the male hostages. With the statement itself, cp. Suet.

velut oraculo (lemnes—‹vluzc (sc. Vitellius). The Gothic king Filimer,
a Christian, expelled massas mulieres, and references to them are fre-
quent in the Teutonic epics. The tenacity with which such women,
in particular, would cling to pagan traditions made them an especial
object of attack on the part ot' the Christian propagandists. By the
time of Charles the Great their infiuence seems to have been broken,
and we hear no more of them, until they revive in the witches of the
Middle Ages. nec: nec ideo, as often in Tacitus. consilia

licited. So far, Tacitus means to say, are the Germans from being
indifferent to the answcrs of their wise women, that they do not even
reject advice which they had not themselves requested. Cp. Plut. (Ie
mulier. virtut. 6 (p. 246 C.) of the Celts: περὶ πολέμου καὶ εἰρήνης
βουλευόμενοι μετὰ τῶν γυναικῶν.
