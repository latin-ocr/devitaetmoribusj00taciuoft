compromising correspomlence was hardly due to the chastity of
German women, but rather to the rarity of writing among them,
the practice not becoming inore general among the Germans till the
lOth century. Even Charles the Great could not write his own name,
Tacitns' desire. to exalt the purity of Germanic society at the expense
of Roman degeneracy has here teinpted him to prove too much. Cp.

striking minti-ast with the great leniency ot' Roman law, according to
which the adulteress was deprived of one third of her separate prop-

German husband, on the other hand, could kill her with his sword,
have her hung, or even burned alive, though Tacitus seems to have
been ignorant of these severer punislnnents (often mentioned in Ger-
man laws), as is evident from ch. 11 ff. et maritis permissa:
this clause is, strictly speaking, superfluous, but it is added to ein-
phasize still further the contrast with the Roman custom in Tacitus‘
time. for it was not till the enactment of Augustus' les: Iulia de aclul-
tersis <18 ns.) that the husband was prohibited from slaying his un-
faithfnl wisc unless caught in the act, though the father had the right
of killing his guilty daughter at any time. abscisis crinibus:

it was a highly prized possession. and to be deprived of it was. there-
fore, a deep humiliation. According to legal documents of the 8th
century7 he who wantonly cut off the hair of a free woman had to pay
nearly four times the fine demanded in the case of a boy. Still earlier
German laws prescribe that the hair of an adulteress should be cut off
at the back of the head.
