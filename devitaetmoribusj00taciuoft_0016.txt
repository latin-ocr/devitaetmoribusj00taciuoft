X INTRODUCTION. II.

Biography, according to al] our ancient authorities, be-
longs to the epideictic branch of literary composition, in
particular the encomium, and its rules are illustrated, as
was natural, in connection with the biography of a king,
the so-called βασιλικὸς λόγος,1 1110 rhetoricians usually citing
as typica] models the still extant Agyesilcms of Xenophon and
the Ezmyoras of Isocrates.2 That the „iffi-{cola partakes of
the character 01 an encomium, a merely cursory perusal could
have confirmed, even if Tacitus had not expressly told us so
himself.3 111 fact, the line of demarcation between a his—
torical narrative and an encomium was a very slight one.4

The constituent parts of a regularly constructed encomium
are the following:5 1. προοίμιον. 2. γένεσις, φύσις, ἀνατροφή.

 

These precepts present a stereotyped sameness, being 011011 reproduced
verbatim from earlier handbooks, and they are, one and all, ulti-
mately derived from treatises reaching back of our era. The Romans
developed no rhetorical systems 01 111011· own, but began in the days
01 Cicero and thereafter with ever-increasing assiduity to copy and
follow the rhetorical canons of the Greeks. For a brief account 01
1110 above rhetoricIans and others, see Christ, Grz'ecln'sche Literatur-
aeschichte 3, pp. 752 ff.

1 That its essential features are common to biographical writing in
general might have been taken 101· granted, even if Menander (Rhet.
Graec. III. 360, 25 Sp. IX. 215 1. W.) had not expressly confirmed it:
οὐ ’γὰρ ἴδιον τοῦτο μόνου τοῦ βασιλέως τὸ ἐγκώμιον, ἀλλὰ, κοινὸν πρὸς
πάντας τοὺς οἰκοῦντας τὴν πόλιν.
