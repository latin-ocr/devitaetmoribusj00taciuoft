with Caes. B. (J. IV. 1, 7, VI. 22,2 ff, the only other extant treat-
ment of the subject, is perhaps the most unsatisfactory in the entire
Germania. Nor ean the trustworthiness of the account be determined,
as there is an interval· of more than a century between Caesar and
Tacitus. On the other hand, the earliest post-Tacitean documents 011
German land tenure are as late as the 5th century, and they relate
to agricultural communities with permanent abodes, whereas the
Germans of 'Tacitus' time had not yet altogether einerged from their
primitive nomadic state3 but the changes in land tenure incident to
that evolution must-have been many and significant. What the author
meant to say, will nevertheless be found tolerably clear, if we emanci-
pate ourselves from the misleading information of a relatively modern
date. pro numero cultorum: the inigrating, conquering tribes
occupied only so much of the acquired extensive domains as could be
tilled or utilized 3 subsequently, definite allotments were pareelled out

course, implies a previous scale of distribution, which served as a
criterion.

by Caesar, are strangely ignored by 'Tacitus They would have ad-
mirably subserved his idealizing tendency, for, as the following shows,
he was not eonvinced that this change from tilled to fallow lands was
made to relieve the soil before exhaustion. The agricultural principle
of the rotation of crops seems, in fact, to belong to a higher civilization.

change so often, since they do not utilize the potential richness and.
the area of the soil to its utmost capacity, by planting orchards, etc.,
which, though requiring considerably more time, would, on the other
hand, yield more satisfactory and better developed products.
