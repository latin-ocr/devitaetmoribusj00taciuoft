a doubtful passage. sudore . . . sanguine: by the semeae qrone's
brow . . . bloodslzed. Alliterative antithesis—these particular ternis
being frequently 0011111111οᾰ- 13 more common in Tacitus than in any
other writer. Cp. Introd. [lyr. p. xxviii. On the epigrammatic close
of the chapter, cp. Incrocl. p. lxiv.

Chapter 15. 5. bella non ineunt: with special reference to
the comitatus, although possibly not exclusive of the better classes
generally. multum venatibus: this is confirmed by many pas-
sages. Cp. ch. 17, 8; 23, 14; 40, 143 Caes. B. G. IV. 1, 8, of the

(sc. Germani). The Germanic mythology, moreover, and the national
epics also furnish superabundant evidence 01 this fondness for the

the contrast With the busy and active Roman.

¹7. Fortissimus . . . hebent: the entire clause virtually reiter-
ates, but more in detail, the thought just brought out. Such fulness
of expression becomes increasingly rare in the later writings of Taci-
tus. Here it is still part of the elevated tone so conspicuous in these
paragraphs. delegata . . . cura feminis: an ablative absolute,
explanatory of the principal thought (here nihil (cacus), is quite Taci-
tean, eg. Agsr. 2, 3. 8; 14, 13; 22, 6; 30, 163 44, 2. The fact here
stated is still true of the Frisians, and the custom obtains 111 many
parts of Ger-many to this day. All this is, of course, 111 glaring contrast
