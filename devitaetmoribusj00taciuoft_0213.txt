aliquando . . . virtusque: sc. redit, as shown by Tacitus's model,
Verg. Aen. II. 367, quondam etium victis redit in praecem-(lisa rinus.
Cp. also Sen. Troad. 671 f.‚ inermes offeram manus Dabit ἵνα rires,
with the same antithesis as in ll. 29 f.

Page 25. 1. adpropinquaverunt: sc. Britanni, easily supplied
from the preceding vz'ctz's, and made necessary by the context. iden—
tidem : to be taken with conlecti, i.e. on approaching the forests, the
Britons repeatedly rallied.

2. primos sequentium incautos: i.e. those Roman soldiers who
festinacione viz-coriae incautiously followed the fleeing enemy in ad-
vance of the pursuing cohorts, the Britons, etc⁴ —The irregular word-
order was caused by a desire for succinet and rhythmica] expression.
--On the use of the adjective (incautos) for the adverb, see note ch.
5, 2. 'she entire passage closely resenibles Liv. XXII. 31, 4.

3. frequens ubique z who was evergwflzere conspicuouslls active. —
The phrase is pleonastic, for the sake of emphasis. Cp. note ch.
22, 16.

4. indaginis modo: caster the mamzer of a cordon. The figure is
taken froin hunting, the wild beasts being driven into one spot and
surrounded by nets. Cp. Verg. Aen. IV. 121. The siinile is very fre-
quently applied to the enclosing of enemies, eg. Liv. VH. 37, 14.

6. persultare: to secur, roam orer. Here, as also elsewhere in
Tacitus, the verb is used in a inore general sense, and therefore appli-
cable to infantry as well. acceptum aliquod . . . fiduciam foret:
the participle is unusually far removed fron] its auxiliary. probably
here for the purpose of securing alliterative groups. Cp. also Lucret.
Ι. 763 Tac. Anu.. XII. 16, coepta . . .f0ret.

7. vulnus: (Zama-(se. This figurative sense of vulnus, especially
frequent with accipere, is a euphennsm for clades. In Tac. again,

Romans had recovered from the confusion into which they had been
thrown, and were again pursuing in battle arr-ay, etc.

9. versizse verterunt. See note ch. 18, 20. alius alium
respectantes z in ‘ne'cem ν. The phrase. als'o with the plural verb,
is found in Sall. Hist. frassm. (Speech of Lepidus) 1. 41, 20 D. alius
alium principem aspectantes, and the construction is quite connnon in
Livy. In Tacitus only here, and used to avoid the repetition of
invicem or incer se.
