by Tacitus. Cp. note Dz'al. 28, 13.

16. philosophiae: this word (like philosophus) is rarely used hy
Tacitus See note ch. 2. a-The apathetic and, at times. hostile
attitude of the Romans toward the study of philosophy is well
attested. See note to Dial. 12⁷», 7. and especially Suet. Nero 52.

17. (studium) hausisse: (sczu‘le'o) se dedisse. The infinitive
represents hauriebat in direct discourse3 hausturum ιΓυίεὸψ, must be
supplied in thought as the apodosis to ni . . . coercuisset. So ch.

18. sublime et erectum: the same collocation occurs 111 Quint.

19. pulchritudinem ac speciem: beautiful ideal. Hendiadys.

21. ratio et aetas: pruclence that comcs with (isse. On the epexe-
getic et, see [Μίνωϊ. p. xxx. The singular predicate with two abstract
nouus joined by ec is the rule in Tacitus. 1 Where the verb in the
singular precedes it may be supposed to agree with the nearer subject.
When the subject-s are joined with (cc or atque, we find the plural, as
in ch. 42. 25. exceptions being very rare. See also Dz'ch. 5. 18.
retinuitque: (cml ῖη consequence he retained. This usage of —que is
extremely frequent in Tacitus. — Observe the harsh change of subject.

22. ex sapientia z the scudy offflzz'losophy. modum : modera-

virtue of his hero, and the rhetoricians speak of it as an essential
element of characterization in encomia. See Izccrocl. p. xii. note 2.
