nent part in the uprising of Civilis. She received eminis-sies, formed
alliances, and the most precious porticus of the booty tell to her share.
Her power was at its height when she correctly predicted the defeat of
the Roman army. On the downfall of Civilis in ΤΟ ΑΛ», she was
brought to Rome as a captive. Cp. Stat. ›51'112 I. 4. ΩΟ, and below.

the statement, reem-e . . . fatidicas. just cited, and probably refers back

prophetie power') mere guesswork and accepted only because it
happens to be in keeping with the context. thether the person here
mentioned by Tacitus is identical with the barbarian woman of super-
human size, who in Latin speech forbade Drusus to advance any
farther, is possible, but not certain. Cp. Suet. Claud. 1; Dio Cass.
LV. 1. compluris alias: eg. the Chatta mulier, mentioned above
(1. 21) ; Ganna, a prophetcss among the Semnones in the time of
Domitian (Dio Cass. LXVII. 5). The Longobardian walaham and
the Alemannian Tltz'om belong to the 9th century. Complures occurs

instead. Cp. note ch. 1, 9.

25. venerati: esteemecl ha'sslzly, did homage to. In this weakened
sense the verb is quite common in Tacitus„ eg. Aqr. 46, 193 Αηη.
VI. 8. facerent deas: as they did later in the case of Veleda (see
above). There is possibly also a satirical side-glauce at the deific‘ation
