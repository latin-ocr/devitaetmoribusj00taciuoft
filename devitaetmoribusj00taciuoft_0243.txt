36. 14. aequa . . . aegre, em] † amna . . . iaeyre, This
emendation of the corrupt text gives a good sense, but it is more than
doubtful, if it represents what Tacitus wrote.

37. 19. vacui spernebant] (vacui) spernebant. vacui 1 believe
to be a gloss 011 passum! estperces, which taken by itseli' is ambiguous.
In any case, the fact that these Britons were raclii cannot have been
given as the reason why they despised the small number of the
Ronmns.

37, 1. iitem] identidem—Hutter.

37, 11. perscrutari] persultare—Rhenanus See F. ad loc.

38, 10. consilia <aliqua>] mnsam aliqua—MSS. See note and

38, 2 f. proximo anno . . . reditura erat] proximo . . . redie-
rat —— MSS. Cp. Andresen and F. ad loc.

39, 6. excepit: this reading may be defended as in note ad loc..

Dz'al. 1, 14 (p. 110 edit. maior).

41, 27. vigorem et constantiam et expertum . . . animum]
riqmvm, czmstantz‘am ec, 616. - Α (Γ). This reading, though hitherto
universally rejected, accords with the consistent practice of Tacitus in ,
1116 use of ec after 311 asyndeton, the third member being amplified and
adding a new and often, as here, the most important element in the
enumeration. Cp. His-c. I. 15, (cited in note oh. 41‚17) and Introd.
p. xxviii.

43, 5. adfirmare ut ausim] quod (Acidalius) firmare (1161111611-
sen, XVoelfflin). The (cd is a corruption of qsl, the lower part of ὅ q·
having become obliterated. The use of the simple verb is quite
Taoitean. Cp. eg. Anu. 1. 81, (Ze comiciis . . . via: quidquam ‚firmare

43, 7 f. libertorum primi et medicorum intimi: as intimi is
